<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>1. How would you describe your role?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Right now, I am a last year PhD student (I plan to defend my thesis in June 2021) at an Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Cracow. However, my favorite way to describe myself is young scientist! I love my job because I get to do a little bit of everything &#8211; I am writing my thesis, managing funding, publishing, leading my own project, working as the vice president of the student council, preparing for scientific stay in the US, and in my free time I love to talk about science!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>2. What are some challenges you have faced in this research?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Anxiety and imposter syndrome are two challenges that I am still working on. I believe the best way to overcome problems is facing them, which is why I always try to push myself to do things outside of my comfort zone.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am currently leading a project concerning nanomaterials. The whole process from writing the proposal, getting the funding to actually doing the research has been an equally amazing and terrifying adventure. Being in charge is extremely gratifying but also requires being prepared for the unexpected.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>3. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My journey into STEM was… a bumpy one. In school I liked math, physics and chemistry… but it wasn’t reciprocated. Even though we had a complicated relationship, my fascination with STEM began in school, when I almost didn’t pass physics class and was made to prepare a presentation about black holes. I started reading a lot of books and I just got hooked on. (We’re made of star stuff?! The Universe is how old?! A teaspoonful of a neutron star would weigh a billion tons?!). The less I understood, the more information I craved. Even though it took me a lot of work and effort, I’ve managed to work on my math and chemistry and decided to go into STEM.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I chose Materials Engineering for my Engineer and Master Degrees as I was looking for something connected with chemistry, but at the same time I wanted that sweet, sweet engineer title. Materials Engineering seemed fun and challenging and that’s how I am were I am today!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>4. What’s the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Materials Science is a fascinating field that combines chemistry, physics and a lot of engineering and if you want to pursue a scientific career and/or a PhD in it, you should start with choosing the right path at the university. Studying Materials Science or Materials Engineering is a great way to start but it’s not the only way! I have friends who are pursuing a PhD in Materials Science, although they have a master’s in physics, chemistry, bioengineering, electronics or metallurgy. This often gives them a unique perspective on the world of Materials Science.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Other than choosing the right studies, the most important thing is to learn to take (calculated) risks (which I’m pretty sure applies to all fields in STEM!). Think big, don’t be afraid – apply for internships and apprenticeships (especially ones that are abroad – there are many ways to fund those!), ask professors if you can help in the lab, look for mentors (there are a lot of mentorships programs in different STEM fields), join societies or science clubs (it’s an awesome way to meet people and work on those soft skills). Get as much of various experiences as you can and stay curious!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>5. What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Everything around us is made from materials – so materials science touches our lives in every possible way. Personally, I work on metals that are liquid at room temperature (just like mercury, however in my case those metals are nontoxic and safe to handle). But people in Materials Science work on all kinds of cool materials and technologies like aerogels (materials literally made from up to 99.8% of nothing), breathable liquids (liquids, that can have so much oxygen dissolved in them that you would actually be able to breathe in them) or shape memory alloys (those are metals that can change shape if for example the temperature changes!).</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>6. What keeps you going in your research? What’s next for your career?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">What keeps me going is the challenge and the opportunity to try new things, go to new places, and meet new people. I put a lot of effort and time into my research because I have fun and I love what I do!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">What’s next? I am not sure yet! I have a few months left in my PhD and although (despite its many problems) I love academia, I would love trying to flirt a bit with industry. At the moment I’ve secured funding for 3 months stay at University College London after my PhD, and I am actively looking for new opportunities!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>7. What is it like to be a woman in STEM? What are some challenges that you have faced?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Materials Science is a STEM fields where there are a lot of women (at least when it comes to students &#8211; it gets worse after getting a PhD). Last year in Poland almost 48% of materials engineering students were female. The data however does not lie – at the grad school level almost the same amount of men and women get funding (for projects, grants and scholarships), however the proportion changes the higher the step in the career is (for example in Poland, for a grant dedicated only for professors, only 8% of the grants were awarded to woman).</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>8. What are 3 things that you wish could change about STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Open access to science – the process of publishers getting all the money, while the authors and reviewers don’t see a penny out of it and then the readers have then to pay for it horrendous amounts of money… It’s not okay. Science should be accessible to all.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Communicating science to the public – the public doesn’t really understand how science works (the misconceptions about Covid-19, are just another proof of that) and we, as scientist and people in STEM, are not doing enough to change that. We don’t talk about how we do science; we don’t try to explain our results in an understandable way, we just don’t talk to the people who very often are the ones paying for the research through their taxes.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left has-medium-font-size">3. Mental health in STEM – there is often a very unhealthy culture in STEM (it will depend on the place, the group and the people but it happens more often than not), forcing people to work long hours, not take breaks and just keep comparing yourself to others. Studies show that the mental health of a lot of PhD students is not the best (in Nature PhD Survey 2019, 36% of students reported that they have sought help for anxiety or depression caused by their PhD studies!) and that is something that should be addressed.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>9. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am not an expert in the field (however there is some scientific research done concerning the topic and I would love to learn more) but what would have personally helped me was to not treat science as a gendered issue. Boys are shown how cars work, for girls it happens much less often. Teachers and parents often assume that boys should be able to repair things or solve computers problems, automatically sending a signal to girls that they don’t need to have that knowledge. We buy boys a lot of cool, science-y toys, and we buy girls dolls, and we expect the kids to form the same interests. Hand on experience with science and technology would have helped me, personally, when I was younger.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>10. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Being a scientist is a viable career option and it allows you to learn new stuff every day, travel the world and push the limits of the Unknown. It’s not going to be easy, but it will be worth it. If you’re curious and willing to work hard, you can do it!</p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>1. What is your specific area of STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am a Software Engineer and I work on building new features for mobile and desktop applications.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>2. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">When I was little, I was always the kid who was curious about how computers worked. Fast-forwarding to when it was time to apply to college I felt that it just made sense to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering. I explored other types of engineering disciplines but realized that I wanted to just apply computer engineering principles to them.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>3. What’s the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There’s so many ways to enter the tech industry. Whether you pursue a traditional or non-traditional route, it is important that you have a good understanding of data structures and algorithms because that is what employers are looking for when you interview. If coding isn’t your strong suit, there are many other jobs such as project management, design, and product management that are also ways of getting into the industry. I would say focus on your interests and let that carry you into your next tech job. </p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>4. What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">People in my field are building a lot of the tools that you use today! If you have a cellphone, use a computer, or anything involving a code/software script, software engineers played a vital part in building them. As a software engineer you have the capability to make an impact on millions of people across the world.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>5. What keeps you going in your profession? What’s next for your career?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">What keeps me going is my quest for knowledge. I still feel like there’s so much that I don’t know and I’m excited to learn more and dive deeper. For my career I want to dive deeper into becoming an industry leader for my technical abilities. </p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>6. What is it like to be a woman in STEM? What are some challenges that you have faced?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">If I am being completely honest, it can be a little isolating and discouraging at times. I struggled a lot with not finding people who could relate to me and to connect with in my classes. When I started working I felt a lot of imposter syndrome and struggled to feel like I belonged or that I was valued. That being said, I found a strong sense of community with my friends outside of the classroom and sought to find a work environment where I felt much appreciated and considered. </p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>7. What are 3 things that you wish could change about STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I wish I could change the lack of diversity within STEM fields  as well as the barriers to enter this field. A lot of jobs in STEM require you to have some sort of formalized education which isn’t always accessible to everyone. Additionally, I would want to change the way there’s so much elitism to be studying STEM. I hated when professors would call a class a “weed out” class. Why are you trying to weed people out? STEM should be inclusive. </p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>8. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Exposure! Seeing more people who look like you pursuing a career in STEM as well as finding fun and creative ways to learn about science provides an excellent avenue to get more girls involved and interested. </p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>9. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">You can do it! It can be hard sometimes, but don’t get discouraged. There’s so much to learn and there’s so many different paths. You can make it work for you.</p>



<p></p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>1. How would you describe your job/role?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">A PhD candidate is somewhere between a student and full-flung researcher. I no longer attend courses, but I am still very much learning. As a graduate student, it is less about memorization and more about problem solving, planning, and applying your knowledge in new ways. I still have a professor who helps in my growth and a committee I update on my progress towards my degree. I have a lot of independence to dive into projects and examine what interests me, with the support of my mentors.<br>A vast majority of my project involves examining thin slices of tissue under a microscope looking for proteins. These proteins glow under florescent light due to a process I put them through, making these beautiful technicolored images. The reason I do this is because I am interested in discovering if certain genes are present in the tissue and are making these proteins. These genes could unlock how the parathyroid and thymus are created!</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>2. What are some challenges you have faced in this research?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My biggest challenge is that the process to make the proteins “glow” (called immunohistochemistry) is easy to mess up. It requires following an exact protocol, otherwise precious samples could be lost forever. There is nothing more frustrating than going through two days of work, looking under the microscope, and seeing nothing! Also, being a PhD candidate can be hard because there are high expectations of your productivity. It can be easy to lose yourself in your work and forget to take a break! Work-life balance is very important in STEM.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>3. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I have always wanted to go into a STEM field, although I didn’t know that I wanted to go into genetics until high school. My mother got her degree in geology, and while she got pushed out of the field due to sexism (my mother was made to do paperwork while her male colleagues got to do field work), she wanted me to know that I could be whatever I wanted and to disregard anyone who said otherwise. Her voice drove me to pursue higher education and be the first person in my family to attend graduate school.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>4. What’s the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I don’t think there is any right way to pursue genetics. A lot of the advice I hear is to join a lab <em>as an undergraduate</em>. But personally, I went to a small liberal arts school and while I got exposure to lab work, this was very different than larger campuses where you can join a traditional “lab”. I also took a gap year between undergraduate and graduate to work in science policy!<br>The closest I came to getting “lab experience” was a few months as a post-baccalaureate researcher in what would eventually become by thesis lab. I think if you’re passionate about being a STEM researcher you can do a lot to gain experience! You can take a gap year and work in biotech, you can be a technician in a lab, you can do research as an undergrad, or even in high school! Whatever works for you and your life experience.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>5. What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are <em>so </em>many things you can do with a degree in genetics! You can work in biotechnology (think companies like 23andMe), biomedicine (Interested in curing cancer? Think about the growing field of immunotherapy!), academia (professors not only get to teach the next generation of scientists, they can continue to make extraordinary jumps in science), science communication or journalism (what better person to explain what CRISPR is than someone who has used it?), or science policy, which is what I plan on going into.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>6. What keeps you going in your research? What’s next for your career?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am a big believer that science should benefit all of society. My current research lands firmly in the biomedical field, which means some day my research might help a future scientist develop a cure to a disease or create a new treatment. Science is constantly building upon itself, so if I could provide even just one leg up to the next scientist with my data, I know I’ve done good.<br>Next up for my career to take my love of science and beliefs about science helping society to the next level- science policy! I am passionate about biosecurity, which means protecting the public from anything that could harm them of biological origin, from pandemics to anthrax. Scientists are always needed in fields like this because we provide expertise and understanding.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>7. What is it like to be a woman in STEM? What are some challenges that you have faced?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Being a woman in STEM can be hard, I won’t deny it. I’ve been sexually harassed by professors and disparaged by male colleagues. I have been told more times than I can count that I am “too pretty to do science” which is, abjectly, the most horrendously stupid thing I have ever heard. Your appearance has nothing to do with your ability to do science. Race, gender, or ability have zero impact on your ability to do science. Luckily, for every comment like that I have met an incredible person who is succeeding and thriving in STEM and is there to support me. And with online and in person communities fostering and supporting diversity in STEM, it is easier now than it has been in the past (for people like my mother) to find a home in STEM. I have so many queer and women role models in STEM that I look up to now!</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>8. What are 3 things that you wish could change about STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">1) The gender and racial disparity in STEM. There are not nearly enough people of color or women in these fields.<br>2) The pressure on graduate students. Graduate students in STEM have some of the highest levels of depression and anxiety, typically due to the sometimes very toxic environments in academia.<br>3) The “Ivory Tower” mentality. Science should be easily accessible and understandable. Scientists can often get lost in their niche that they only ever communicate with other scientists. Most of our research is funded by the public, so our research should be too, not hidden behind paywalls!</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>9. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Exposure. You cannot know if you are interested in something if you’ve never witnessed it! For example, my mother often bought me toys that were from the “boys” section because that’s where things like science kits, dinosaur toys, and other STEM-related toys were located. I am so glad that in recent years this has changed some, but a lot of work still needs to be done. A Barbie in a lab coat is great, but let’s push our girls to keep asking questions and to not be discouraged in school (especially high school). Let’s show them famous women scientists and what they discovered, and let’s get them in the lab, behind the computer, or in the field out having <em>fun</em>.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>10. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Never, ever let anyone tell you that you aren’t good enough to be what you want to be. That includes adults! If something makes you excited or curious, chase that feeling. If you change your mind, that is totally fine, but let it be because <em>you</em> want to do something else, not because the world said you should. It’s hard, I know, but sometimes being stubborn isn’t a bad thing.<br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Greetings fellow Earthlings! My name is Tanya, I’m a chemical and biomolecular engineer that develops environmental technology for terrestrial and space applications. Clean water is vital no matter where you are in the universe, I dream about a world where we don’t have to worry about drinking harmful contaminants. I’d like to share my story for all the women out there facing similar obstacles in life. Some parts will come across as sad but don’t worry, things get better as you keep reading.<br /><br />My childhood was pretty rough, grew up in a low-income single parent household with 5 siblings. I saw and experienced more things during my first 10 years of life than anyone should ever have to go through. Luckily, very very luckily, my grandparents helped me escape that situation in my early teens and adopted me. We moved across the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It took a while for me to shake the trauma and bad behaviors I picked up from childhood. Ended up dropping out of high school (do not recommend, stay in school) and it took a while to build myself back up. I got a GED, picked up a job as a waitress, and started taking classes at the local community college (it&#8217;s all I could afford at the time).&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">After getting an associate&#8217;s degree, I transferred to a 4 year university. Halfway through the program I got sick. Really sick. Unfortunately, I was too stubborn at the time to take a break from school (I was literally doing homework in the hospital) and ended up falling behind and failing out of college. I was devastated. My grandparents, the greatest people on this planet, encouraged me to keep trying and find a new door to open.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I wrote a letter to the dean at a college ~2 hours away, explaining my situation and practically begging for a second chance. To my surprise at the time, they accepted me! I&#8217;ll forever be thankful for Prairie View A&amp;M university. My health got better, I maintained a high GPA, and met a space job recruiter by chance while studying in the library.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">After talking to the recruiter for 10 minutes, I knew space science was the right career for me. She was extraordinary, I was inspired by her poise and passion. After an official interview, I received an offer to be an intern that summer.</p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#1829aa;">1<em>. How would you describe your job/role?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In space and on Earth, we take wastewater and use technology to turn it into potable water. That means removing contaminants and harmful microbes from various water sources in order to make safe drinking water. Astronauts like to joke that “yesterday’s coffee is today’s coffee.” When you’re beyond low earth orbit without an abundant supply of water, you have to tap into every potential source such as urine. It’s actually quite complicated to turn urine into drinking water, it’s full of things you don’t want to consume like urea, volatile compounds, inorganic molecules, and bacteria. The further we travel into space, the more water sources we’ll need to sustain life, such as greywater (shower and laundry) and planetary water, each full of things you don’t want to drink. My role is to dream of and develop technologies to clean these water sources.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In parallel, my PhD research focuses on facilitating access to clean water almost anywhere in the world by developing efficient modular water treatment systems that&nbsp;are easy to deploy, that can tap unconventional sources to provide humanitarian water, and develops systems to treat and reuse challenging industrial wastewaters in remote locations. Specifically, I use nanotechnology to remove harmful contaminants such as nitrate in agricultural runoff water and transform them into innocuous compounds that are safe for consumption.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#1829aa;">2. <em>What are some challenges you have faced in this research?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I’ve grown a deep appreciation for gravity. When you take that away, things get weird (and fun). Liquids move differently, gas molecules behave differently, and processes that work on Earth don’t work the same in space. Designing technology around these obstacles is challenging, we’re almost always met with a surprise or two once our hardware makes it to space.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#1829aa;">3. <em>What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Chemical engineering is all about taking one molecule and transforming it into another molecule. Taking one form or energy and converting it into a different form. It’s driven by the fundamental and empirical laws of the universe; I find that deeply comforting and beautiful. In the words of Neil Armstrong, “I&nbsp;am, and ever will be, a white-socks,&nbsp;pocket-protector,&nbsp;nerdy engineer,&nbsp;born under the second law of thermodynamics,&nbsp;steeped in steam&nbsp;tables, in love with free-body diagrams, transformed by Laplace and propelled by compressible flow.”</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#1829aa;">4. <em>What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are so many cool things, it’s hard to choose which one to talk about! In my PhD program, I’m part of an engineering research center full of extraordinary people working on groundbreaking research for water treatment. Using light and nanophotonic to manipulate water, electric fields to influence molecular behavior, magnetic particles to hook-and-bait harmful contaminants, it’s all so fascinating.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">When it comes to space, I’m always fascinated by the work done by Dr. Mark Weislogel and that team. Mark specializes in capillary fluids, he’s a wizard when it comes to water in microgravity. Using engineering shapes and geometry, they can bend and control the behavior of water to move without using a pump or external forces. Pretty cool. Really really cool.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#1829aa;">5. <em>What is it like to be a woman in STEM? What are some challenges that you have faced</em>?</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I’m proud to be a woman in STEM and very grateful for all the women in the world that have fought and are continuing to fight for equality in the workplace. I carry their strength, resilience, determination, and sisterhood with me. I’m very fortunate, at both my space job and my PhD program, women are respected, treated with respect, and our achievements are celebrated and recognized.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, this has not always been the case. At a previous job, no matter how hard I tried, folks disregarded my abilities and didn’t take me seriously. I was flaunted around for being “the girl” and invited to big meetings and dinners with important clients just because of my gender. I hate that this is a story that every woman in STEM has and I look forward to a day when that is no longer true.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#1829aa;">6<em>. What are 3 things that you wish could change about STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f469-1f3fb-200d-1f680.png" alt="👩🏻‍🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />The number of women in STEM. Women constitute less than 30% of the STEM industry. STEM jobs are building the world and future, solving our world’s greatest challenges. I want to see more women at the forefront of these endeavors.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f469-1f3fb-200d-1f680.png" alt="👩🏻‍🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />The accessibility to STEM for girls growing up in low-income communities. We need to address social oppression, we need to give students in the 5<sup>th</sup> ward access to the same resources as students in ivy league schools, we need to help these students learn that they are not bound by their situation.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f469-1f3fb-200d-1f680.png" alt="👩🏻‍🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />The lack of recognition given to women in STEM. I cried happy tears a few days ago when it was announced that 3 women in STEM are receiving the Nobel Prize this year. At the same time, I felt sad – of the 605 people awarded Nobel prizes in scientific disciplines (chemistry, physics, physiology or medicine) from 1901 to 2017, only 18 were women. That’s less than 3%.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#1829aa;">7. <em>What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">When I was growing up, we were taught that women can be one or the other, the “smart girl” or “the girly girl.” You don’t have to choose and you can be both if you want to. If you want to be a cheerleader that thinks bugs are cool and listens to both heavy metal and pop music, do it. Wear makeup or don’t wear makeup, wear dresses or wear sweatpants or wear both, wear heels or old sneakers or both…do whatever you enjoy and makes you happy. Science doesn’t care about any of that, all you need is a curious mind.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hello, my name is Laura and I am a Marine Biology student at University of Portsmouth. I completed my foundation degree (FdSc) in Marine Ecology and Conservation at University Centre Sparsholt in Winchester this past June. I have recently moved down to Portsmouth to do a top up year which will give me a full honors BSc degree in Marine Biology. I have always loved being by the coast, whether it be rock pooling, bodyboarding, going on boat trips or simply swimming. I soon realized that studying the ocean would be my dream, however I never thought I would have the grades or intelligence to do it. However, by doing a foundation degree I was able to find a way into my dream field where I originally thought I would never have the chance.</p>

<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>1. How would you describe your role?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Currently I am a University student, so I am still studying for my bachelor’s degree. As I am in my final year, I am working on my final year project which involves doing independent research on a chosen subject and writing a scientific paper about the subject discussing what you have found. The research that I will be looking at focuses on dolphin identification and analyzing dolphins dorsal fin scars to explore not only the origins of the scars but if there are patterns in which they occur. The sorts of patterns I will be looking into may include “Do dolphins get more scars at certain times of the year?”, “Do male dolphins have more scars than female dolphins?” and “Are younger dolphins more likely to get scars than older dolphins?”. Although I am yet to start my research, I have a good understanding of these focuses and can’t wait to see what I find out.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>2. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I actually didn’t know what STEM was until I started university. Since discovering what STEM was, I realized that women are very underrepresented and there are far too many people out there that think that women can’t/are unable to have a job in STEM discipline.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I do have some massive inspirations that helped me realize that Marine Biology was something that I wanted to pursue. Dr. Sylvia Earle is my biggest inspiration and a woman I would love to meet. Sylvia is a Marine Biologist and oceanographer who is now 85 and has spent her life researching the oceans and raising awareness for the need of conservation. She has a charity called Mission Blue (which is also the name of her Netflix documentary which I thoroughly recommend everyone to watch) which helps to create ‘Hope spots’ of marine protected areas. She has also done many talks around the world, including one for TED which is about 10 minutes long and a must watch.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>3. What’s the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In terms of school to be able to study marine biology at university you want to make sure you have focused your studies at school to some of the sciences. Biology, Geography and Maths are pretty useful to have; however, they are not always necessary depending on where you want to study but will give you a good head start.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Its always good to try and get volunteer work either before or whilst you’re studying for your degree. If you live near the coast you may be able to organize local beach clean ups, this will show that you are driven and organized. There may also be local rescue centers for animals such as seals who may take volunteers. Otherwise any sort of aquarium, pet shop, conservation or wildlife organization will be beneficial.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>4. What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are so many amazing things going on in Marine Biology at the moment. There are companies that are growing and replanting corals to help restore coral reefs that have been affected by climate change. There are companies who are tagging marine animals such as sharks and turtles in order to be able to track and research their patterns in terms of migration, feeding and reproduction. Restoring seagrass beds, dealing with oil spills, research in laboratories in microbiology, diving research and much more.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>5. What keeps you going in your research? What’s next for your career?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am hoping to go on to do a masters in either Marine Biology, Marine Ecology and Conservation or Marine Mammal science once I have completed my BSc. After this I hope to be able to travel the world and do research and raise awareness for conservation of the oceans.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>6. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I honestly think social networking can be a real help. Since starting my marine biology Instagram account, I have met so many amazing women in STEM and in my field specifically. It can be so useful to know other people in the field. Everyone has their own areas and each friend you make will be able to give you tips and tricks on certain things whether it be diving centers/sites in a certain country, sustainability and eco friendly tips, best universities for masters degrees, best places to find volunteer work and books/journals/papers to read. Once you have a community of other women in STEM you feel unstoppable and supported and motivated to keep pushing and inspiring more women to join STEM disciplines.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>7. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Don’t let other people put down your dreams. If you want something enough and you work hard enough you will be able to do anything. It is your life and you are the one that has to live it so you can’t let people tell you what you can and can’t do.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hi, I am Ami and I am a Biomedical and Instrumentation engineer. I am originally from India but have been living in the US with my husband and a toddler for quite some time. Back in India, I have worked as a service engineer and a bio-medical (a.k.a clinical) engineer for different companies and hospitals. Apart from that I enjoy cooking, traveling and occasional hiking. I have a degree in HR management and used to tutor kids in Math. Now after a long professional gap, I have decided to pursue Masters.</p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>1. What is your specific area of STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Engineering- I am a biomedical and instrumentation engineer.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>2. How would you explain your STEM field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a person who has years of experience in this field, I can boldly say that it is one of the most interesting and exciting fields one can study, research and work in. Biomedical and instrumentation engineers design medical equipments and devices like artificial organs, body parts and machines for diagnosing health related complexities.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>3. What are some challenges you face in this field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a biomedical engineer the biggest challenge that I&#8217;ve faced is dealing with the customers. In my experience, providing technical support involves on-site visits, working cross-functionally across teams, managing and staying up-to-date with inventories and nudging customers in the right direction to get a product or part that will suit their needs. But what I love the most about my role is that I get to work with customers and help them with a cost-effective equipment planning solution.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>4. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Physics and Math have always interested me. I love the challenges that science and technology throws at us. One day I just thought to myself, how incredible would it be to do something that could change or save lives? Biomedical and instrumentation engineering gave me the chance to do something meaningful with my life. I would say the field itself has proven to be an inspiration to me.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>5. What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Engineers in my profession put great effort in designing and successfully building artificial organs like kidneys, hearts, legs, joints, blood vessels and so on. We also build devices like pacemaker and hearing aids and provide support with it&#8217;s installation, maintenance and educate customers on it&#8217;s usage.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>6. You mentioned continuing your education after a long gap. How does it feel to get back in STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Honestly, I am really excited. It&#8217;s definitely going to be a bit of a challenge since I have a one year old to take care of but nevertheless, I feel empowered. I worked hard to get admission in graduate school- I even joined community college and started working on a field-related course. I manage home and take care of my kid and once my husband gets back from work, I take some time for myself and focus on the course. Over the past months I gained new skills and brushed some old ones. I feel inspired.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>7. What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am completely aware of the gender parity issue in STEM. Things are getting better but I firmly believe that we need more role models to rectify the fact and correct me if I am wrong, we as women have to work harder than men for gaining trust and respect of people in our field.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>8. What message would you like to give to our STEM moms?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As moms we face enough challenges every day, add education and it becomes a whole new level of juggling. It is important to stay positive and focus on the goods rather than the challenges because one day or the other your degree is going to open a whole new window of opportunities. One thing to remember and I don&#8217;t mean to sound cheeky- we are women. We have the ultimate gift of multi-tasking. So to all my ladies, brace up and conquer the world. All you need is a will and a dash of courage. Age is no bar and your kids are your strength, don&#8217;t stop pursuing your goals by making them your weakness.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size">My career journey has taken me on a complete rollercoaster of a ride to get to where I am today.<br><br>From the age of 10 it was my dream to join Cirque du Soleil, I travelled all around Australia on tour with the circus, whilst undertaking the same schooling as any normal kid. In my graduating year I got injured, and I came to the realisation that I needed a plan B.<br><br>This led me to studying Business and Accounting at university, I fell in love with studying and left my circus dreams behind. I naturally excelled at Accounting which subsequently led me to believe this was the career for me. I studied part time and worked part time at a tax accounting firm, whilst managing 4 other casual jobs.<br><br>By the time I graduated I realised accounting was definitely not for me. Feeling a bit lost I found myself starting up a recruitment division in Melbourne specialising in Salesforce. After almost a year into my role I caught myself spending more time learning about Salesforce and Marc Benioff then actually recruiting. So I took one day off and did what I knew best and that was to recruit. I called all the companies in Australia that specialised in Salesforce implementations and sold myself in as a junior candidate.<br><br>Before I knew it I was working for a Platinum Salesforce Marketing Cloud partner, learning to code and configure the platform for our customers.<br><br>At this point I started my side hustle FIIT Collective, and 2 years later joined Salesforce.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">1. <strong><em>What is your specific area of STEM?</em></strong><br>Salesforce Solution Engineer and Founder of FIIT Collective</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">2. <strong><em>How would you explain your STEM field?</em></strong><br>In my full time role at Salesforce I support Account Executives in the pre-sales cycle. I spend a lot of my time understanding the business challenges organisations face, and solution design how the Salesforce platform can help overcome those challenges. As a part of my role I need to understand the full technical capability of the Salesforce platform as well as, implementation best practices and industry trends relevant to the customers I am working with. &nbsp;<br>As a founder of a small business supporting women in tech, I feel the responsibility to help close the gender gap in tech. It’s my dream to live in a world where diversity and inclusion is second nature, and society no longer uses labels such as “Female CEO”, just CEO. Where women feel confident in applying for jobs when they only meeting a fraction of requirements, in the same way men do. A world where women can be their authentic self at work, and leverage their female superpowers, rather than adopting male characteristics. And most importantly for women to know they can “have it all” and do not have to choose between motherhood, or their career.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">3. <strong><em>What are some challenges you face in this field?</em></strong><br>You’re often considered as the smartest person in the room, with that I find myself putting pressure on myself to know everything &#8211; which is completely unrealistic.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">4. <strong><em>What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong><br>I honestly fell into it. It wasn’t planned… I have always followed my passion and that led me to the great success I have had today.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">5. <strong><em>What’s the best way to enter your field?</em></strong><br>I honestly believe aptitude and attitude go so much further then your technical knowledge. You can teach tech, you can’t teach attitude.<br>What helped me land my role at Salesforce was enthusiasm and specialisation. I saw opportunities in the market very early on to specialise in a platform that very little people knew about. I took a calculated risk, knowing that this specialisation would sky-rocket my career when the market demanded for this skillset.<br>I was right, this skill set along with my hunger to learn helped me land my dream job.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br>6. <strong><em>What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong><br>I love that every single day is different&#8230; and with technology rapidly advancing each day, it requires me as a solution engineer to keep up to date with the latest tech, industry trends and product releases.<br>Outside of my role I have submitted two innovations to the US patent office which is pretty cool.<br>I also get to present a lot at events, about our latest innovations&#8230;<br></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">&nbsp;7. <strong><em>What keeps you going in your profession?</em><br></strong>I am very aligned to my purpose which is to empower and educate females in tech to live a more purposeful career and life. Every single day I get to pursue that purpose in both my day job and side hustle.<br>When you know your purpose you’re intrinsically motivated and don’t need external factors to keep you on track and productive.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br>8. <strong><em>What is FIIT Collective?</em></strong><br>It’s a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fiitcollective.com/" target="_blank">platform to educate and empower women in tech to live a more purposeful career and life</a>. It all started with my <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/tamarajohanna_/" target="_blank">instagram</a>, then progressed into a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://fiitcollective.com/" target="_blank">female in tech blog</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/the-females-in-tech-show-with-tamara-johanna/id1479316259" target="_blank">podcast</a>. Soon I will be releasing e-learning products and webinars to help women accelerate their career in tech.<br></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">9. <strong><em>What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in STEM?</em></strong><br>Being a blonde female, I sometimes find it challenging to be taken seriously in customer meetings. People subconsciously judge me for being female, and at times question my technical capability because of the way I look. I used to take this personally, but now I use it to my advantage…&nbsp;<br></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">10. <strong><em>What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong><br>Personal branding played a big role in the success I have had today. I didn’t have the luxury of having family connections to get into big tech or consulting corporate giants&#8230;&nbsp; I had to find my own way into my dream company, and I did that through my personal brand.<br>Regardless if you have these internal connections or not, your personal brand will help you get the salary and promotions you deserve.&nbsp;<br>I encourage you to take time out weekly to build your personal brand and become a thought leader with people inside and outside of your workplace.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size">My name is Nicole Young and I am a developer and freelancer based in Pennsylvania, USA.&nbsp; I got into tech after I graduated from college with a degree in Psychology. I was planning on accepting an offer for a PhD but instead was given the opportunity to go to Malaysia for a year for an academic grant to teach English. When I returned, I wanted to continue to pursue opportunities where I could be more hands on and found a job at a tech startup. I learned so much in the two year that I was there and was introduced to coding and resources that inevitably helped me to teach myself development and start freelancing.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>1.What is your specific area of STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am a technologist. Not only am I a developer but I also pay attention to the trends, patterns and practices of the industry. I think that it is important to do that no matter the field.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>2.How would you explain your STEM field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I use my skills to help people build an online presence so that they can reach the people that they want to help. I build websites and provide other services to help people make a good impression online.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>3.What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I was inspired by the work that I was doing in my first job and inspired by all of the new things that I was learning. I chose Tech because it felt right to me. It was where I felt like I could make the largest impact.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>4.What’s the best way to enter your field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">No matter what age you are right now there are ways that you can start getting in to tech and coding right now! There are lots of games and websites geared toward helping young people understand how to code and build the problem solving skills that they need to be successful at it.&nbsp; Take some time to explore the websites and social media platforms that you are on everyday and learn a bit about how they are made. It will definitely amaze you!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>5.What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Anything that you can access on the web right now was built by someone with a development or engineering skill set, Developers like me work each day to create the cool websites, software, games and social media platforms that we all know and love!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>6.What keeps you going in your profession?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Keep a steady habit of learning is important and keeps me going. Also staying curious and wanting to push myself to create new and awesome things keeps me interested in what I do.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>7.What are your future career goals?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I would like to start my own organization where I help other women and people of color learn new tech skills for free where they can be placed in jobs that will give them new opportunities to learn a high paying skill.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>8.What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in stem?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It can feel lonely at times. I am often the only woman of color in the spaces that I am in and it can feel isolating and discouraging. There is also things like imposter syndrome (not feeling like I belong or am qualified enough to do what I do) and the feeling that I have to prove myself to those around me more than everyone else does.&nbsp; Those all can take a toll on you mentally and emotionally, which can make it tough to move forward sometimes.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>9.What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Stay curious and focused on your goals. Experiment and never be afraid to try new things.&nbsp; I think there is a lot of pressure on young people to have their lives figured out before they entered the real world and I want whoever is reading to know &#8211; that’s not true! It will take time but keep chasing the things that fill you with joy and fire because those things will lead you to what is best for you!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hello! I&#8217;m Daisy and I&#8217;m an experimental quantum physics PhD candidate at the University of Surrey&#8217;s Advanced&nbsp;Technology Institute.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I&#8217;ve been interested in science for as long as I can remember, although I also have a passion for art and  was torn between pursuing art or science as a career. I eventually settled on science and opted to keep my creative pursuits as hobbies. What I&#8217;ve come to realise is that to be a scientist and a researcher you need to be creative so that side of me comes in handy when I&#8217;m solving problems and designing new experiments. Once I&#8217;d decided to do science I then had to decide which one! I knew I had more interest in the physical sciences and as physics was my favourite&nbsp;subject from when I was 16, I opted to do a physics degree.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">During the later years of high school, I had a lot of trouble with socialising and developed&nbsp;major depressive disorder and generalised anxiety disorder. It wasn&#8217;t until near the end of my degree that I was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and my challenges since high school began to make sense. I now have autism-specific support at my university and speak openly about the challenges and strengths of being autistic. During my degree, I had the opportunity to do a year of research for my master&#8217;s project so I applied to be a research and development intern at the Centre for Integrated Photonics where I worked on designing and testing semiconductor lasers for telecommunications applications. After graduating from my MPhys, I applied to do PhDs in quantum technologies and I started my PhD in 2018 working on a project on &#8216;development of InSb quantum point contacts for quantum technology applications&#8217;. I absolutely love my research and regularly talk about it as well as my experience as an autistic person in STEM and academia on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/notesfromthephysicslab/"><em>social media</em></a> and my <a href="https://www.notesfromthephysicslab.com/links"><em>blog</em></a>.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em><strong>1.What is your specific area of STEM?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My current sub-field is semiconductor spintronics. This falls under the larger field of quantum technologies. These fields are quite interdisciplinary with physicists, materials scientists, engineers and chemists all working within it. I approach my work from the perspective of experimental quantum physics, so I get to delve into the fundamental quantum physics phenomenon as well as looking at the fabrication and engineering side of things.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em><strong>2.How would you explain your STEM field?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Semiconductor spintronics is a field which looks at exploiting electron spin in semiconductor materials for quantum technology applications. Let me break down all that jargon a bit: Semiconductors are a group of materials which can sometimes behave like a conductor and sometimes like an insulator. They have highly &#8216;tunable&#8217; properties and are the materials used in most technology these days. All of the transistors and other components in your phone and computer are made from predominantly semiconductor materials. They also make up a lot of the telecommunications infrastructure as semiconductors can be used to make lasers and other optical devices such as LEDs. Spintronics is short for &#8216;spin transport electronics&#8217; and it essentially is an extension of electronics. In electronics, we use the charge of electrons in materials to make technology and spintronics extends that to include an additional degree of freedom: spin. One of the most interesting applications of spintronics is in quantum computing where it is a key concept for solid-state electron spin qubits. My current research looks at ways to produce a current of electrons with a particular spin state using nanostructures made from semiconductor quantum wells which can be used to initialize&nbsp;spin-based qubits.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>3.What are some challenges you face in this field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It&#8217;s a very new field so there are still lots of things we don&#8217;t know. But in a way, this is what makes it exciting! More generally, I have some challenges with my communication and processing differences due to being autistic but I&#8217;m developing great self-advocacy skills to enable me to work to the best of my ability (and this isn&#8217;t really a field-specific challenge, just more of a general life challenge).</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>4.What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My decision to get into quantum physics comes from a class in high school. In chemistry, we were learning about electron shells in atoms and the concept of electron spin was mentioned. I instantly became fascinated with what this meant and asked my teacher who told me to ask a physics teacher. I did and since then had a fascination with quantum physics and the concept of spin. In fact, applied quantum physics is one of my longest-standing autistic &#8216;special interests&#8217; which is why I am so drawn to it as a career. I&#8217;ve also been very inspired by the incredible Emmy Noether since high school and find her to be such a role model for trailblazing women in physics and mathematics.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>5.What’s the best way to enter your field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I don&#8217;t think there is one particular &#8216;best&#8217; route for anything really. If you want to be a quantum physicist I do think you need a good grounding in physics&#8211; whether that is a degree or an apprenticeship (for example, the National Physical Laboratory offers science apprenticeships).&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>6.What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There&#8217;s always so much amazing research coming out of quantum technology! Probably the most notable is the recent work from Google reaching &#8216;quantum supremacy&#8217;. Although there is a lot of hype around it, we still have a long way to go (decades probably) until we see anything resembling a functioning, commercially viable quantum computer.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>7.What keeps you going in your profession?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Knowing that I am part of the research effort towards new technologies which help advance progress in a whole host of disciplines.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>8.What are your future career goals?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I would like to be working in quantum technology R&amp;D, whether that is in academia or industry. I&#8217;d also like to develop my science communication freelance work so that I can help educate people on physics online as well as raise awareness about topics I&#8217;m passionate about such as making STEM more accessible to disabled people.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>9.What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I stick out within my research group due to my gender. I hope that in the future this isn&#8217;t the case but not many women progress to senior positions in physics and I&#8217;m very aware of that. Sometimes there are comments about my gender which strike me as odd because surely the most important thing about my academic work is the quality of my research, not my gender!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>10.What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you have a passion for STEM then go for it. Contrary to stereotypes, you don&#8217;t need to be anything apart from curious, determined and have a thirst for knowledge to work in STEM fields!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">1.<em><strong>What</strong></em> <strong><em>is your specific area of STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I work as a software engineer within the tech industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">2.<strong><em>What is the best way to enter your field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">One of the great things about software engineering is that there’s never just one way to do things! This includes breaking in. The most traditional option is to get a 4 year undergraduate degree in computer science and apply for software engineering internships along the way, culminating in a full time job as a software developer after college. But this definitely isn’t the only way! There are coding boot camps worth looking in to that teach the skills necessary to become a full-fledged software developer in just a few months. Yet another option is to use an online course platform such as Udemy to self-tech yourself programming and begin freelancing from there!&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">3.<strong><em>What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Software engineers work on every application on your phone! They work on your automated kitchen appliances and your home security system. Even when you’re going to get a drink at Starbucks, you’ve used applications spanning thousands of lines of code! From using your Maps app to get to the store to the application the cashier uses to punch in your order, you’re often using software everywhere without even realizing it!&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">4.<strong><em>What keeps you going in your profession?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Something that I love at my job is that every day is different. Every day I get to solve a new problem that no-one else has worked on before! The more complex the task, the greater feeling of accomplishment at the end of the day.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">5.<strong><em>What are your future career goals?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As an advocate of minorities in tech, my goal within the tech community is to normalize and start discussions about difficult situations within the workplace. I try to empower others by providing potential solutions to these problems and provide a platform for others to build off of each other and connect.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In general I divide my goal focuses by category: career, personal skills, financial, and health. My overarching theme for 2020 has been exploration. I’m trying to delve into new ideas with a more open mind.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My career goals involve broadening my skillset technically as well as non-technically, translating to moving up the engineering ladder.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">6.<strong><em>What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in stem?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It’s no secret that the odds are stacked up against women in STEM trying to build a successful career. One of the biggest challenges adding on to that is imposter syndrome. The way I define imposter syndrome is when one constantly and repeatedly doubts the legitimacy of their accomplishments and is worried that they don’t deserve to belong or succeed. I face this in waves, usually when in periods of great growth.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">7.<strong><em>What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">If I can suggest two virtues to develop, they would be clear communication and persistence — these have changed the game for my career and personal life. Just know that if you set your mind to it, you CAN and WILL succeed.</p>

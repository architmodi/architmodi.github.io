<p class="has-normal-font-size">1.What&#8217;s your story?</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Born and raised in Dallas, TX, I quickly realized that you don’t have to go to a third world country to find people who lack basic necessities. My single mother put all of our needs before hers and after feeling a mass on her breast, she decided to ignore because who would pay for the doctor visit? Playing ball with my brother, a freak accident occurred and she was hit in the chest by the ball. The insane pain forced her to get checked and was notified of having breast cancer. This emotional incident gave my life a purpose- advocating for women&#8217;s health and well-being.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">2.What is your specific area of STEM?</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I am pursuing a medical degree, potentially in gynaecology.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">3.What does being a woman in STEM means to you?</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">For me to be a woman in STEM means to be a leader in my community. I want to use my education and science for the betterment of my community.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">4.What are some really cool things you have got a chance to work on?</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Working in research has been very fulfilling for me. I am a research assistant at the <em>Center For Global And Public Health </em>at <em>Southern Methodist University</em>, and I have worked on research involving HPV, cervical cancer, and breast cancer.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">5.What are your future career goals?</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I aspire to develop a women’s health program in low income communities.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">6.What message would you like to give to our young readers?</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">My message to anyone who wants to study is DO NOT BE AFRAID. You can do anything if you stay driven and determined. Your struggles will push you towards success.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><em>1.What&#8217;s your story?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I developed keen interest in engineering from a very early age, so as soon as I got into senior high I took classes for computer science, only to realize I was actually interested in electronics! This is how I knew I wanted to become an electronics engineer. It was my dream to be a professor so I decided to do masters in the same. While pursuing masters I got an opportunity to become a teaching assistant. This helped me get some insight and teaching experience. But just when I thought everything was falling into place, I lost my sweet mother. I was mourning over her loss, juggling personal responsibilities and work to get a full-time teaching position at my university. It was one heck of a year but I thrived and became Assistant Professor at the same university. Now I get to do what I love everyday, teach.<img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><em>2. How would you explain your STEM field?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Electronics is one of the core engineering fields and it has been there since forever. It gives you an opportunity to understand the most important component or you can say, the heart of any device- processor. This field has a wide spectrum of topics like digital signalling, image processing, computer architecture and networks to name a few. If circuits and breadboards interests you, I think Electronics is waiting for you.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><em>3. What are some really cool things people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I am an engineer, but teaching has become my main profession. It is very satisfying to pass on the knowledge and help students become better engineers. Other than mentoring students, one of the cool things that we work on is research and data analysis of student&#8217;s progress. It helps us understand each student better and implement different techniques for achieving better results. It is interesting how every student is unique and needs a different approach.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><em>4. What does being a woman in STEM means to you?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I am aware of the gender discrimination in our field, but nothing is going to stop a woman with strong will to reach the heights she wants to. Being in STEM brings me immense joy and satisfaction and I would like to encourage women not only in STEM but any field to do anything that brings them happiness.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><em>5. What keeps you going?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I love sharing knowledge and I am lucky I get to do it every single day. I enjoy spending time with my students, teach them, learn from them. It&#8217;s like I am living my dream. I also believe in staying up to date with new technologies so currently I am learning about data science and machine learning.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><em>6. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">We are smart enough to make good choices for ourselves but not every person is lucky enough to get proper support or backing. Being a professor, I see a lot of young girls inclined towards STEM. I would still like to encourage more girls/women to take STEM and make their mark in this field. There is so much to do and so little of us. We need more women in STEM, so join us and help explore more. This field has so much to offer!</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size">Hi! My name is Mariana and I was born in Colombia. After my family and I survived one of the worst earthquakes in the Colombian history, we moved to Spain to start a new life. We faced struggles settling down but somehow managed to find a place to live and a spot for me in public school. One day, my mother showed me a news article about Dr Anna Veiga, the first scientist in Spain who succeeded in in-vitro fertilization, this urged me to become like her. I was 17 when I realized I wanted to be a medic and gave my best to become one. Unfortunately, I faced anxiety and panic attacks throughout my exams and contests that I participated for getting into medicine. One day, my mother showed me another news article: “ Bioinformatics, the Medicine of the Future”, this inspired me to my core. I recently graduated with a degree in Bioinformatics and currently studying MPhil in Medical Science at the University of Cambridge.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">1. <em>What is your specific area of STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Bioinformatics. It is the art of using computational resources in any scientific field (maths, physics, chemistry, biology and so on). For me, I chose to focus on Medical Sciences and stem cells &#8211; I am currently working at the Haematology department at the University of Cambridge, so the cells I am focused on are blood stem cells.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">2. <em>What goals do you have for the future?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">My short-term goals are to pursue a PhD at the University of Cambridge and to grow as a science communicator on social media to help others to fight for their dreams, especially in stem fields.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">3. <em>What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Our lab is divided between experimentalists and bioinformaticians, and we all work on Haematopoiesis (the study of blood cell types formation). The bioinformaticians work from mathematical models to machine learning and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis. In my case, I’m in the last group: I’m working on developing a computational pipeline for single-cell multimodal analysis (samples obtained using NGS)</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">4. <em>What keeps you going in your field?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I have loved studying stem cells since I was 17! Now I have the chance of using my “futuristic” bioinformatics skills in this field. It’s incredible to know I can keep learning everyday, don&#8217;t you think?</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">5. <em>What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in stem?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Though it is getting better, I still find it very difficult to see gender equality. There still are lack of women in STEM. I remember my first day at the Faculty of Informatics, there was a group of men sitting in the cafe and they whispered, “look, I bet she got lost” &#8211; they were talking about me! The worst mistake is to assume a woman is not capable of pursuing or being interested in STEM fields.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">6. <em>What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I would suggest them not listening to everything that people say. I have been psychologically attacked by narrow-minded people who kept saying that I should remember where I came from and stop dreaming about studying overseas. People have said that I cannot afford higher education in a foreign country, that I cannot get into medicine, and that maybe I should stop thinking about STEM fields. People have said that I am too young to leave home because it seems scary, I have heard them complain of me spending too much time studying instead of having fun (but they have no idea how fun I find my job!). I have experienced this so I can tell you that it’s your time to prove yourself and the world how STRONG you can be. Don’t stop, KEEP DREAMING.</p>

<p>Hi, I am Urja and I am in the final year of dentistry. Choosing a field in medicine was the easiest decision of my life. I am a doctor and I enjoy helping people. Other than that, I am an ambivert and I love to party! I have a degree in Bharatnatyam, I was an athlete in school and still enjoy sports, and I am always up for learning new things. Thanks to quarantine, I learned to do digital art!</p>

<ol><li><em>How would you explain your stem field to young girls?</em></li></ol>



<p>We are the teeth doctors! We specialise in oral health and diagnose oral diseases. We create treatment plans for patients and help maintain or restore their oral health, we also take x-rays, monitor growth and development of teeth/jaws, and perform surgeries if necessary. In short, we help you keep your mouth happy.</p>



<p>2. <em>Why did you choose your STEM field? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p>My dad’s an Orthopaedic surgeon, watching him treat people and earn respect had an effect on me. Well, it was either that or MR’s gifts (just kidding). I decided to study MBBS but getting admission for medical is definitely not a piece of cake. Unfortunately, while I was preparing for my entrance, government changed rules and the admission process was going to be based solely on NEET. This was really important to me but at the same time I was running short on prep time. The pressure was real and unfortunately I got hit by anxiety. Long story short, I pushed through and got myself a nice seat for dentistry and I am enjoying this field ever since.</p>



<p><strong>3. </strong><em>What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p>What is usually the first thing you notice in a person? Smile. So I guess one of the coolest things that people in my profession do is smile designing. We also treat defects or disabilities that people are born with or get due to some disease. We assist in something known as “habit breaking”- believe me, it is exactly what it sounds like. We help patients break habits like thumb sucking, tongue thrusting and so on. And as a dentist, I am really proud of this last one- we promote anti-tabocco campaigns.</p>



<p><strong>4. </strong><em>What keeps you going in your profession?</em></p>



<p>I strongly believe that one of the worst pains in human body is tooth ache, so it makes me happy to offer my help for relieving that pain. It warms my heart when I see a smile back on my patient’s faces. My work gives me tremendous satisfaction and my happy patients is what keeps me going.</p>



<p><strong>5. </strong><em>What goals do you have for the future?</em></p>



<p>A lot of people even in the developed countries ignore dental health. I would really like to spread awareness about importance of dental hygiene and help avoid the risk of diseases like oral cancer.</p>



<p>6. <em>What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p>Smile changes how a person is pursued. It plays a vital role in developing one’s personality and yet people underestimate the power of oral health. But guess what, we are here for them. As a dentist you can help people look good and spread awareness about dental hygiene. Help us spread smiles <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>My name is Sukanya, and I am a data scientist! I have a Master&#8217;s degree in Business Analytics and I love reading (check out – ‘Why We Sleep’ and thank me later <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />), calligraphy, and researching about data science. Being a minority, I am always looking for ways to encourage more women in STEM. I also have been a part of Women In Data Science conferences, so here&#8217;s another attempt to do the same.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<ol><li><em>What&#8217;s your story?</em></li></ol>



<p>I started my career as a software engineer but craved on solving more challenging problems employing cutting-edge technologies. And just then I stumbled upon Masters in Analytics program which was a step ahead of coding. It had an enticing combination of math (one of my early childhood fascinations) and coding for uncovering useful information hidden in data. I jumped at the opportunity and so far this field has never ceased to fascinate me with it&#8217;s advancements.</p>



<p></p>



<p><em>2. What is your specific area of STEM?</em></p>



<p>My focus is Data Science. It is a subset of Artificial Intelligence and includes statistics, probability, coding (Python is the most in-demand, R comes next), and machine learning.</p>



<p></p>



<p><em>3. How would you explain your STEM field to young girls?</em></p>



<p>Data Science is the field of drawing actionable insights from data. In plain English, it means that you get historical data, you find underlying patterns in it. For an instance, ice-cream sales go up when temperature rises. This leads to you recommending your boss that we should sell more ice-cream in summers. This way sales increase, boss is happy, you get promoted, and it’s a win-win!</p>



<p></p>



<p><em>4. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p>I chose this field as it combines two things I like &#8211; math and coding. But more importantly, it allows me to reach the ultimate goal of better decision making. Growing up, a lot of my decision-making was based on random choices and lots (lots! lots!) of elderly advice. Being in this field forces me to take better evidence/data-backed decisions myself.</p>



<p></p>



<p><em>5. What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p>Data Science is filled with mind-boggling things that people work on. To name a few –</p>



<ul><li>predicting future: which customer will leave the company; which patient will go on to develop a disease. And my personal favorite – predicting who will commit bank fraud!</li><li>recommendations: Amazon, Etsy, Spotify, any and everyone who recommends stuff to customers uses data science to understand user preferences,</li><li>extracting handwritten text from scanned documents,</li><li>recognizing cats vs dogs in pictures,</li><li>chatbots, and many more.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<p><em>6. What keeps you going in your profession?</em></p>



<p>Two things: (1) the power of discovering answers from data and (2) there is so much more to learn and so little that I know.</p>



<p></p>



<p><em>7. What goals do you have in your career?</em></p>



<p>I want to gain depths of knowledge and experience to be able to drive decisions for high-impact business problems and create positive change. Eventually, I want to apply my skillset towards social good such as solutioning for climate change, agricultural productivity and plastic waste reduction.</p>



<p></p>



<p><em>8. What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in STEM?</em></p>



<p>I have had a very few women role models in STEM, whose stories of pushing through struggles and shattering the glass ceiling would be something I could look up to. I have also had fewer opportunities (than I would like) of working with compassionate and ambitious women in managerial/senior leadership roles. The reason I think having a supportive network of women is important because they can empathize better on certain experiences you witness in the career like for example, managing emotional intelligence while working as a part of a team. &nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p><em>9. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p>STEM lays the core foundation for innovation, and innovation is the only constant. So grab a seat at the table where decisions are made, be at the forefront of change and make use of the powerful tools that STEM has to offer to solve complex and rewarding problems.</p>



<p></p>

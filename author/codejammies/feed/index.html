<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hello, my name is Laura and I am a Marine Biology student at University of Portsmouth. I completed my foundation degree (FdSc) in Marine Ecology and Conservation at University Centre Sparsholt in Winchester this past June. I have recently moved down to Portsmouth to do a top up year which will give me a full honors BSc degree in Marine Biology. I have always loved being by the coast, whether it be rock pooling, bodyboarding, going on boat trips or simply swimming. I soon realized that studying the ocean would be my dream, however I never thought I would have the grades or intelligence to do it. However, by doing a foundation degree I was able to find a way into my dream field where I originally thought I would never have the chance.</p>

<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>1. How would you describe your role?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Currently I am a University student, so I am still studying for my bachelor’s degree. As I am in my final year, I am working on my final year project which involves doing independent research on a chosen subject and writing a scientific paper about the subject discussing what you have found. The research that I will be looking at focuses on dolphin identification and analyzing dolphins dorsal fin scars to explore not only the origins of the scars but if there are patterns in which they occur. The sorts of patterns I will be looking into may include “Do dolphins get more scars at certain times of the year?”, “Do male dolphins have more scars than female dolphins?” and “Are younger dolphins more likely to get scars than older dolphins?”. Although I am yet to start my research, I have a good understanding of these focuses and can’t wait to see what I find out.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>2. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I actually didn’t know what STEM was until I started university. Since discovering what STEM was, I realized that women are very underrepresented and there are far too many people out there that think that women can’t/are unable to have a job in STEM discipline.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I do have some massive inspirations that helped me realize that Marine Biology was something that I wanted to pursue. Dr. Sylvia Earle is my biggest inspiration and a woman I would love to meet. Sylvia is a Marine Biologist and oceanographer who is now 85 and has spent her life researching the oceans and raising awareness for the need of conservation. She has a charity called Mission Blue (which is also the name of her Netflix documentary which I thoroughly recommend everyone to watch) which helps to create ‘Hope spots’ of marine protected areas. She has also done many talks around the world, including one for TED which is about 10 minutes long and a must watch.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>3. What’s the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In terms of school to be able to study marine biology at university you want to make sure you have focused your studies at school to some of the sciences. Biology, Geography and Maths are pretty useful to have; however, they are not always necessary depending on where you want to study but will give you a good head start.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Its always good to try and get volunteer work either before or whilst you’re studying for your degree. If you live near the coast you may be able to organize local beach clean ups, this will show that you are driven and organized. There may also be local rescue centers for animals such as seals who may take volunteers. Otherwise any sort of aquarium, pet shop, conservation or wildlife organization will be beneficial.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>4. What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are so many amazing things going on in Marine Biology at the moment. There are companies that are growing and replanting corals to help restore coral reefs that have been affected by climate change. There are companies who are tagging marine animals such as sharks and turtles in order to be able to track and research their patterns in terms of migration, feeding and reproduction. Restoring seagrass beds, dealing with oil spills, research in laboratories in microbiology, diving research and much more.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>5. What keeps you going in your research? What’s next for your career?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am hoping to go on to do a masters in either Marine Biology, Marine Ecology and Conservation or Marine Mammal science once I have completed my BSc. After this I hope to be able to travel the world and do research and raise awareness for conservation of the oceans.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>6. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I honestly think social networking can be a real help. Since starting my marine biology Instagram account, I have met so many amazing women in STEM and in my field specifically. It can be so useful to know other people in the field. Everyone has their own areas and each friend you make will be able to give you tips and tricks on certain things whether it be diving centers/sites in a certain country, sustainability and eco friendly tips, best universities for masters degrees, best places to find volunteer work and books/journals/papers to read. Once you have a community of other women in STEM you feel unstoppable and supported and motivated to keep pushing and inspiring more women to join STEM disciplines.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>7. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Don’t let other people put down your dreams. If you want something enough and you work hard enough you will be able to do anything. It is your life and you are the one that has to live it so you can’t let people tell you what you can and can’t do.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hi, I am Ami and I am a Biomedical and Instrumentation engineer. I am originally from India but have been living in the US with my husband and a toddler for quite some time. Back in India, I have worked as a service engineer and a bio-medical (a.k.a clinical) engineer for different companies and hospitals. Apart from that I enjoy cooking, traveling and occasional hiking. I have a degree in HR management and used to tutor kids in Math. Now after a long professional gap, I have decided to pursue Masters.</p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>1. What is your specific area of STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Engineering- I am a biomedical and instrumentation engineer.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>2. How would you explain your STEM field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a person who has years of experience in this field, I can boldly say that it is one of the most interesting and exciting fields one can study, research and work in. Biomedical and instrumentation engineers design medical equipments and devices like artificial organs, body parts and machines for diagnosing health related complexities.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>3. What are some challenges you face in this field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a biomedical engineer the biggest challenge that I&#8217;ve faced is dealing with the customers. In my experience, providing technical support involves on-site visits, working cross-functionally across teams, managing and staying up-to-date with inventories and nudging customers in the right direction to get a product or part that will suit their needs. But what I love the most about my role is that I get to work with customers and help them with a cost-effective equipment planning solution.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>4. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Physics and Math have always interested me. I love the challenges that science and technology throws at us. One day I just thought to myself, how incredible would it be to do something that could change or save lives? Biomedical and instrumentation engineering gave me the chance to do something meaningful with my life. I would say the field itself has proven to be an inspiration to me.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>5. What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Engineers in my profession put great effort in designing and successfully building artificial organs like kidneys, hearts, legs, joints, blood vessels and so on. We also build devices like pacemaker and hearing aids and provide support with it&#8217;s installation, maintenance and educate customers on it&#8217;s usage.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>6. You mentioned continuing your education after a long gap. How does it feel to get back in STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Honestly, I am really excited. It&#8217;s definitely going to be a bit of a challenge since I have a one year old to take care of but nevertheless, I feel empowered. I worked hard to get admission in graduate school- I even joined community college and started working on a field-related course. I manage home and take care of my kid and once my husband gets back from work, I take some time for myself and focus on the course. Over the past months I gained new skills and brushed some old ones. I feel inspired.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>7. What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am completely aware of the gender parity issue in STEM. Things are getting better but I firmly believe that we need more role models to rectify the fact and correct me if I am wrong, we as women have to work harder than men for gaining trust and respect of people in our field.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>8. What message would you like to give to our STEM moms?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As moms we face enough challenges every day, add education and it becomes a whole new level of juggling. It is important to stay positive and focus on the goods rather than the challenges because one day or the other your degree is going to open a whole new window of opportunities. One thing to remember and I don&#8217;t mean to sound cheeky- we are women. We have the ultimate gift of multi-tasking. So to all my ladies, brace up and conquer the world. All you need is a will and a dash of courage. Age is no bar and your kids are your strength, don&#8217;t stop pursuing your goals by making them your weakness.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Have you ever been micromanaged by someone? Turns out more than half of the working population experiences micromanagement. So there is a possibility that you have experienced it too. Certainly, this is something neither the employees nor the employer is proud of. Often micromanagement kills productivity since no one likes someone breathing down their neck all the time. Micromanagement often brings the efficiency down and creates an unhealthy work environment for the employees. But what causes micromanagement? Doubts about employee’s competency, urge to be in control all the time, overly detail-oriented and much more which we will discuss shortly.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-yellow-background-color has-background has-large-font-size">SIGNS YOU ARE BEING MICROMANAGED</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />You are being asked to provide frequent updates.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Even the simplest decision is questioned by the manager.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />You feel being controlled most of the times.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />You are losing confidence.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />You are always worrying about how the manager will react.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-yellow-background-color has-background has-large-font-size">IF YOU ARE BEING MICROMANAGED, DO THIS:</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Gain the micromanager’s trust- Prove that you are capable of handling things on your own.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Document everything you do- I learned this from my mentor and it has personally helped me.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Meet deadlines.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Keep the micromanager in loop in case of any changes. It is important to anticipate a situation and provide updates upfront at least in the beginning to help them with the whole trust process.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Ask for feedback from the manager about your performance.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Communicate how you feel- Usually micromanagers are not aware that they are micromanaging. People try to improve efficiency but end up becoming controlling. There is a thin line between being detail-oriented and obsessive, and unfortunately employees are the ones realizing it first. Let the manager know how this is in fact affecting your efficiency and mental health in your next 1:1.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-yellow-background-color has-background has-large-font-size">IF YOU ARE A MICROMANAGER, DO THIS:</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Learn to trust- Each employee has a different way of working. If a person doesn’t work the way you do, it doesn’t mean they are incompetent.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Focus on the end result- Instead of interrupting the process, give your employees a chance to perform tasks according to them. If the end result doesn’t satisfy you, you can suggest a different approach. But give people a chance.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Let go- We all have and will make mistakes at work, and in fact it is one of the best ways to learn. While judging an employee take both achievements and mistakes into consideration instead of just focusing on the mistakes. Try not to label employees as incompetent just on the basis of a few mistakes.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Communicate your basic expectations from the employees and ask them to work towards meeting them.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Ask for feedback from the employees on your leadership.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Try to revisit your non-managerial days.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Sometimes the reason people micromanage is because they have been micromanaged by their managers. We learn from our experiences and if this is the only experience your manager have had then it is going to be difficult for them to not replicate it. Be patient and help your manager realize what they are doing is not serving the purpose.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size">My career journey has taken me on a complete rollercoaster of a ride to get to where I am today.<br><br>From the age of 10 it was my dream to join Cirque du Soleil, I travelled all around Australia on tour with the circus, whilst undertaking the same schooling as any normal kid. In my graduating year I got injured, and I came to the realisation that I needed a plan B.<br><br>This led me to studying Business and Accounting at university, I fell in love with studying and left my circus dreams behind. I naturally excelled at Accounting which subsequently led me to believe this was the career for me. I studied part time and worked part time at a tax accounting firm, whilst managing 4 other casual jobs.<br><br>By the time I graduated I realised accounting was definitely not for me. Feeling a bit lost I found myself starting up a recruitment division in Melbourne specialising in Salesforce. After almost a year into my role I caught myself spending more time learning about Salesforce and Marc Benioff then actually recruiting. So I took one day off and did what I knew best and that was to recruit. I called all the companies in Australia that specialised in Salesforce implementations and sold myself in as a junior candidate.<br><br>Before I knew it I was working for a Platinum Salesforce Marketing Cloud partner, learning to code and configure the platform for our customers.<br><br>At this point I started my side hustle FIIT Collective, and 2 years later joined Salesforce.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">1. <strong><em>What is your specific area of STEM?</em></strong><br>Salesforce Solution Engineer and Founder of FIIT Collective</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">2. <strong><em>How would you explain your STEM field?</em></strong><br>In my full time role at Salesforce I support Account Executives in the pre-sales cycle. I spend a lot of my time understanding the business challenges organisations face, and solution design how the Salesforce platform can help overcome those challenges. As a part of my role I need to understand the full technical capability of the Salesforce platform as well as, implementation best practices and industry trends relevant to the customers I am working with. &nbsp;<br>As a founder of a small business supporting women in tech, I feel the responsibility to help close the gender gap in tech. It’s my dream to live in a world where diversity and inclusion is second nature, and society no longer uses labels such as “Female CEO”, just CEO. Where women feel confident in applying for jobs when they only meeting a fraction of requirements, in the same way men do. A world where women can be their authentic self at work, and leverage their female superpowers, rather than adopting male characteristics. And most importantly for women to know they can “have it all” and do not have to choose between motherhood, or their career.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">3. <strong><em>What are some challenges you face in this field?</em></strong><br>You’re often considered as the smartest person in the room, with that I find myself putting pressure on myself to know everything &#8211; which is completely unrealistic.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">4. <strong><em>What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong><br>I honestly fell into it. It wasn’t planned… I have always followed my passion and that led me to the great success I have had today.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">5. <strong><em>What’s the best way to enter your field?</em></strong><br>I honestly believe aptitude and attitude go so much further then your technical knowledge. You can teach tech, you can’t teach attitude.<br>What helped me land my role at Salesforce was enthusiasm and specialisation. I saw opportunities in the market very early on to specialise in a platform that very little people knew about. I took a calculated risk, knowing that this specialisation would sky-rocket my career when the market demanded for this skillset.<br>I was right, this skill set along with my hunger to learn helped me land my dream job.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br>6. <strong><em>What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong><br>I love that every single day is different&#8230; and with technology rapidly advancing each day, it requires me as a solution engineer to keep up to date with the latest tech, industry trends and product releases.<br>Outside of my role I have submitted two innovations to the US patent office which is pretty cool.<br>I also get to present a lot at events, about our latest innovations&#8230;<br></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">&nbsp;7. <strong><em>What keeps you going in your profession?</em><br></strong>I am very aligned to my purpose which is to empower and educate females in tech to live a more purposeful career and life. Every single day I get to pursue that purpose in both my day job and side hustle.<br>When you know your purpose you’re intrinsically motivated and don’t need external factors to keep you on track and productive.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br>8. <strong><em>What is FIIT Collective?</em></strong><br>It’s a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fiitcollective.com/" target="_blank">platform to educate and empower women in tech to live a more purposeful career and life</a>. It all started with my <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/tamarajohanna_/" target="_blank">instagram</a>, then progressed into a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://fiitcollective.com/" target="_blank">female in tech blog</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/the-females-in-tech-show-with-tamara-johanna/id1479316259" target="_blank">podcast</a>. Soon I will be releasing e-learning products and webinars to help women accelerate their career in tech.<br></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">9. <strong><em>What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in STEM?</em></strong><br>Being a blonde female, I sometimes find it challenging to be taken seriously in customer meetings. People subconsciously judge me for being female, and at times question my technical capability because of the way I look. I used to take this personally, but now I use it to my advantage…&nbsp;<br></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">10. <strong><em>What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong><br>Personal branding played a big role in the success I have had today. I didn’t have the luxury of having family connections to get into big tech or consulting corporate giants&#8230;&nbsp; I had to find my own way into my dream company, and I did that through my personal brand.<br>Regardless if you have these internal connections or not, your personal brand will help you get the salary and promotions you deserve.&nbsp;<br>I encourage you to take time out weekly to build your personal brand and become a thought leader with people inside and outside of your workplace. You never know where your next opportunity might be…</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are 5 types of internal gateway routing protocols and OSPF is one of them. But what makes it so special? One of the best things about OSPF is that it is open source in nature meaning, it can run on routers manufactured by different vendors. OSPF is a link-state internal gateway protocol that follows Dijkstra algorithm. It&#8217;s administrative distance is 110 and uses multicast addresses 224.0.0.5 and 224.0.0.6 for exchanging information between it&#8217;s neighbors. It uses cost as it&#8217;s metric and IP port 89 for packet transfer. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In this post you will learn about- <em>OSPF tables, Types of routers, LSA types, OSPF packet types , OSPF states and OSPF areas</em></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-yellow-background-color has-background has-large-font-size"><strong>OSPF Tables</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>1. Neighbor Table-</strong> Stores information about neighboring OSPF routers.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size">Command-<em> show ip ospf neighbor</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>2. Topology Table-</strong> Stores all possible routes learned from neighboring routers.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size">Command-<em> show ip ospf database</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>3. Routing Table-</strong> Stores only best path to destination.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size">Command- <em>show ip route ospf</em></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-yellow-background-color has-background has-large-font-size"><strong>OSPF Routers</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>1. Area Border Router (ABR)- </strong>Routers that are located on the borders of each OSPF area and are connected to multiple areas, are known as ABRs. In addition, ABRs summarize IP addresses of each OSPF area.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>2. Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR)-</strong> Similar to ABRs, ASBRs are connected to different OSPF areas, however, they are also connected to routers with different routing protocols like EIGRP, EGP etc.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>3. Designated Router (DR)-</strong> DR generates LSAs and exchange information with other routers in the same area. DR uses multicast address 224.0.0.5 to send updates to other routers and all routers except DR uses the multicast address 224.0.0.6 to send LSU and LSA packets to the DR.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>DR Election- DR is elected by routers on the basis of router priority. The router with highest priority is elected as DR.</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>4. Backup Designated Router (BDR)- </strong>As you might have guessed by the name, BDR is a backup designated router in case the actual designated router fails. In case of a DR failure, BDR is will act as a DR and a new BDR will be elected.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>BDR Election- BDR is elected by routers on the basis of router priority. The router with second highest priority is elected as BDR.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center has-yellow-background-color has-background has-large-font-size"><strong>OSPF LSA Types</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Before moving forward with this topic, let&#8217;s have a brief look at LSA. Link State Advertisements (LSAs) are information about routes that are transported inside Link State Updates (LSUs). Each LSU packet contains one or more LSAs, and when an LSU is sent between routers, it floods the LSA information through the network. This is also known as LSDB flooding. Receiving OSPF routers store LSAs inside Link State Database (LSDB). Once LSDBs between the routers sync, OSPF finds a best path using Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) algorithm for each network.</p>

<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>LSA header content- LS age (2 Bytes), Options (1 Byte), LS Type (1 Byte), LS ID (4 Bytes), Advertising router (4 Bytes), LS sequence number (4 Bytes), LS checksum (2 Bytes), Length (2 Bytes)</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>1. Router LSA- </strong>Also known as Type 1 LSAs, are sent between routers within the same area. These carries information about the interfaces of router and it&#8217;s adjacent neighbors.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>2. Network LSA-</strong> Also known as Type 2 LSAs, are generated and flooded between the routers in the same area by the Designated Router (DR) in order to describe directly connected routers.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>3. Summary LSA- </strong>These are generated by Area Border Routers (ABRs) to advertise directly connected areas to other areas.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>4. ASBR Summary LSA- </strong>These are generated by ABRs in order to let other routers known where the Autonomous System Border Routers (ASBRs) are located.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>5. External LSA-</strong> Also known as ASBR External LSAs, are generated by ASBR to advertise external redistribution routes into the OSPF&#8217;s autonomous system.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>6. Multicast LSA-</strong> Supposedly supports multicast routing through OSPF, but is not used much and is anticipated to be outdated soon.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>7. NSSA External LSA- </strong>Not-so-stubby-area packets are used for the areas which does not allow Type 5 LSA packet. NSSA External LSA acts as a mask to Type 5 LSA packets and help them move through these areas.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-yellow-background-color has-background has-large-font-size"><strong>OSPF Packet Types</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>1. Hello</strong>&#8211; Hello packet is used for discovering, forming and maintaining OSPF neighborship</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>2. Database Description-</strong> DBD is a summary of LSDB, it&#8217;s responsibility is to check whether the LSDB between 2 routers is the same. LSDB contains updated link-state information exchanged among the network and all routers within the same area share the same LSDB. When 2 routers form new neighbor adjacencies, they sync their LSDBs to be fully adjacent.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>3. Link State Requests-</strong> LSR is used for requesting missing LSDB information by OSPF routers.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>4. Link State Updates-</strong> LSU is a packet in response to LSR. It carries the missing piece of information requested by the OSPF routers.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>5. Link State Acknowledgement-</strong> Once the OSPF router receives missing LSDB information through LSU, it sends out an LSAck packet to acknowledge the transfer.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-yellow-background-color has-background has-large-font-size"><strong>OSPF States</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In order to become OSPF neighbors, routers need to go through the following states-</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>1. Down-</strong> This state indicates that no hello packets are received from neighbor as yet.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>2. Attempt-</strong> This state is only valid for manually configured neighbors.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>3. Init-</strong> This state specifies that the router has received a hello packet from its neighbor, but the receiving router&#8217;s ID was not included in the hello packet.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>4. Two-way</strong>&#8211; This state specifies that both routers received hello packets and have each other&#8217;s router IDs and a two way communication is established. In the end of this state, DR and BDR are elected.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>5. Exstart</strong>&#8211; Once the DR and BDR are elected, the actual process of exchanging link state information can start between the routers and their DR and BDR. In this state, the routers and their DR/BDR establish a master-slave relationship and choose the initial sequence number for adjacency formation. The router with the higher router ID becomes the master and starts the exchange.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>6. Exchange</strong>&#8211; In this state, OSPF routers exchange Database Descriptor packets.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>7. Loading-</strong> Based on the information provided by the DBDs, routers send Link State Request (LSR) packets. The neighbor then provides the requested information in Link State Update (LSU) packets. During the adjacency, if a router receives an outdated or missing LSA, it requests that LSA by sending a Link State Request (LSR) packet. After receiving the requested information, routers will send acknowledgement through LSAck packet.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>8. Full</strong>&#8211; This state indicates that routers have completely formed adjacencies with one another and are now sharing synced databases.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-yellow-background-color has-background has-large-font-size"><strong>OSPF Areas</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">OSPF implements a 2-layer area architecture- backbone area and non-backbone area. Backbone area is also commonly known as Area 0. This, as the name suggests is the spine of the OSPF network. Every non-backbone area is physically or virtually connected to the OSPF Area 0. Non-backbone areas are where the users are placed. Let&#8217;s have a brief look at all non-backbone areas-</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>1. Standard Area</strong>&#8211; As mentioned earlier, this area should be connected to the Area 0 of OSPF. This area allows intra-area, inter-area, external and a default routes.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>2. Stub Area</strong>&#8211; Stub areas are typically implemented when routers with limited capacities are used in OSPF networks. These are typically used in hub-and-spoke network. Stub areas accept intra-area routes but do not allow external routes.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>3. Totally Stubby Area</strong>&#8211; This area is Cisco proprietary and does not accept external AS routes or inter-area routes. It only recognizes intra-area routes and the default route.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>4</strong>. <strong>Not So Stubby Area (NSSA)</strong>&#8211; NSSA allows intra-area, inter-area and the default route (0.0.0.0).</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hope you enjoyed this post, I will be back with another OSPF article soon. Until next time<img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f379.png" alt="🍹" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size">My name is Nicole Young and I am a developer and freelancer based in Pennsylvania, USA.&nbsp; I got into tech after I graduated from college with a degree in Psychology. I was planning on accepting an offer for a PhD but instead was given the opportunity to go to Malaysia for a year for an academic grant to teach English. When I returned, I wanted to continue to pursue opportunities where I could be more hands on and found a job at a tech startup. I learned so much in the two year that I was there and was introduced to coding and resources that inevitably helped me to teach myself development and start freelancing.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>1.What is your specific area of STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am a technologist. Not only am I a developer but I also pay attention to the trends, patterns and practices of the industry. I think that it is important to do that no matter the field.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>2.How would you explain your STEM field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I use my skills to help people build an online presence so that they can reach the people that they want to help. I build websites and provide other services to help people make a good impression online.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>3.What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I was inspired by the work that I was doing in my first job and inspired by all of the new things that I was learning. I chose Tech because it felt right to me. It was where I felt like I could make the largest impact.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>4.What’s the best way to enter your field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">No matter what age you are right now there are ways that you can start getting in to tech and coding right now! There are lots of games and websites geared toward helping young people understand how to code and build the problem solving skills that they need to be successful at it.&nbsp; Take some time to explore the websites and social media platforms that you are on everyday and learn a bit about how they are made. It will definitely amaze you!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>5.What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Anything that you can access on the web right now was built by someone with a development or engineering skill set, Developers like me work each day to create the cool websites, software, games and social media platforms that we all know and love!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>6.What keeps you going in your profession?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Keep a steady habit of learning is important and keeps me going. Also staying curious and wanting to push myself to create new and awesome things keeps me interested in what I do.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>7.What are your future career goals?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I would like to start my own organization where I help other women and people of color learn new tech skills for free where they can be placed in jobs that will give them new opportunities to learn a high paying skill.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>8.What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in stem?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It can feel lonely at times. I am often the only woman of color in the spaces that I am in and it can feel isolating and discouraging. There is also things like imposter syndrome (not feeling like I belong or am qualified enough to do what I do) and the feeling that I have to prove myself to those around me more than everyone else does.&nbsp; Those all can take a toll on you mentally and emotionally, which can make it tough to move forward sometimes.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>9.What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Stay curious and focused on your goals. Experiment and never be afraid to try new things.&nbsp; I think there is a lot of pressure on young people to have their lives figured out before they entered the real world and I want whoever is reading to know &#8211; that’s not true! It will take time but keep chasing the things that fill you with joy and fire because those things will lead you to what is best for you!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hello! I&#8217;m Daisy and I&#8217;m an experimental quantum physics PhD candidate at the University of Surrey&#8217;s Advanced&nbsp;Technology Institute.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I&#8217;ve been interested in science for as long as I can remember, although I also have a passion for art and  was torn between pursuing art or science as a career. I eventually settled on science and opted to keep my creative pursuits as hobbies. What I&#8217;ve come to realise is that to be a scientist and a researcher you need to be creative so that side of me comes in handy when I&#8217;m solving problems and designing new experiments. Once I&#8217;d decided to do science I then had to decide which one! I knew I had more interest in the physical sciences and as physics was my favourite&nbsp;subject from when I was 16, I opted to do a physics degree.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">During the later years of high school, I had a lot of trouble with socialising and developed&nbsp;major depressive disorder and generalised anxiety disorder. It wasn&#8217;t until near the end of my degree that I was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and my challenges since high school began to make sense. I now have autism-specific support at my university and speak openly about the challenges and strengths of being autistic. During my degree, I had the opportunity to do a year of research for my master&#8217;s project so I applied to be a research and development intern at the Centre for Integrated Photonics where I worked on designing and testing semiconductor lasers for telecommunications applications. After graduating from my MPhys, I applied to do PhDs in quantum technologies and I started my PhD in 2018 working on a project on &#8216;development of InSb quantum point contacts for quantum technology applications&#8217;. I absolutely love my research and regularly talk about it as well as my experience as an autistic person in STEM and academia on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/notesfromthephysicslab/"><em>social media</em></a> and my <a href="https://www.notesfromthephysicslab.com/links"><em>blog</em></a>.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em><strong>1.What is your specific area of STEM?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My current sub-field is semiconductor spintronics. This falls under the larger field of quantum technologies. These fields are quite interdisciplinary with physicists, materials scientists, engineers and chemists all working within it. I approach my work from the perspective of experimental quantum physics, so I get to delve into the fundamental quantum physics phenomenon as well as looking at the fabrication and engineering side of things.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em><strong>2.How would you explain your STEM field?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Semiconductor spintronics is a field which looks at exploiting electron spin in semiconductor materials for quantum technology applications. Let me break down all that jargon a bit: Semiconductors are a group of materials which can sometimes behave like a conductor and sometimes like an insulator. They have highly &#8216;tunable&#8217; properties and are the materials used in most technology these days. All of the transistors and other components in your phone and computer are made from predominantly semiconductor materials. They also make up a lot of the telecommunications infrastructure as semiconductors can be used to make lasers and other optical devices such as LEDs. Spintronics is short for &#8216;spin transport electronics&#8217; and it essentially is an extension of electronics. In electronics, we use the charge of electrons in materials to make technology and spintronics extends that to include an additional degree of freedom: spin. One of the most interesting applications of spintronics is in quantum computing where it is a key concept for solid-state electron spin qubits. My current research looks at ways to produce a current of electrons with a particular spin state using nanostructures made from semiconductor quantum wells which can be used to initialize&nbsp;spin-based qubits.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>3.What are some challenges you face in this field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It&#8217;s a very new field so there are still lots of things we don&#8217;t know. But in a way, this is what makes it exciting! More generally, I have some challenges with my communication and processing differences due to being autistic but I&#8217;m developing great self-advocacy skills to enable me to work to the best of my ability (and this isn&#8217;t really a field-specific challenge, just more of a general life challenge).</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>4.What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My decision to get into quantum physics comes from a class in high school. In chemistry, we were learning about electron shells in atoms and the concept of electron spin was mentioned. I instantly became fascinated with what this meant and asked my teacher who told me to ask a physics teacher. I did and since then had a fascination with quantum physics and the concept of spin. In fact, applied quantum physics is one of my longest-standing autistic &#8216;special interests&#8217; which is why I am so drawn to it as a career. I&#8217;ve also been very inspired by the incredible Emmy Noether since high school and find her to be such a role model for trailblazing women in physics and mathematics.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>5.What’s the best way to enter your field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I don&#8217;t think there is one particular &#8216;best&#8217; route for anything really. If you want to be a quantum physicist I do think you need a good grounding in physics&#8211; whether that is a degree or an apprenticeship (for example, the National Physical Laboratory offers science apprenticeships).&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>6.What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There&#8217;s always so much amazing research coming out of quantum technology! Probably the most notable is the recent work from Google reaching &#8216;quantum supremacy&#8217;. Although there is a lot of hype around it, we still have a long way to go (decades probably) until we see anything resembling a functioning, commercially viable quantum computer.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>7.What keeps you going in your profession?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Knowing that I am part of the research effort towards new technologies which help advance progress in a whole host of disciplines.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>8.What are your future career goals?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I would like to be working in quantum technology R&amp;D, whether that is in academia or industry. I&#8217;d also like to develop my science communication freelance work so that I can help educate people on physics online as well as raise awareness about topics I&#8217;m passionate about such as making STEM more accessible to disabled people.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>9.What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I stick out within my research group due to my gender. I hope that in the future this isn&#8217;t the case but not many women progress to senior positions in physics and I&#8217;m very aware of that. Sometimes there are comments about my gender which strike me as odd because surely the most important thing about my academic work is the quality of my research, not my gender!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>10.What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you have a passion for STEM then go for it. Contrary to stereotypes, you don&#8217;t need to be anything apart from curious, determined and have a thirst for knowledge to work in STEM fields!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>

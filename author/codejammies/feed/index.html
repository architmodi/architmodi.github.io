										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-normal-font-size">My name is Nicole Young and I am a developer and freelancer based in Pennsylvania, USA.  I got into tech after I graduated from college with a degree in Psychology. I was planning on accepting an offer for a PhD but instead was given the opportunity to go to Malaysia for a year for an academic grant to teach English. When I returned, I wanted to continue to pursue opportunities where I could be more hands on and found a job at a tech startup. I learned so much in the two year that I was there and was introduced to coding and resources that inevitably helped me to teach myself development and start freelancing.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>1.What is your specific area of STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I am a technologist. Not only am I a developer but I also pay attention to the trends, patterns and practices of the industry. I think that it is important to do that no matter the field.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>2.How would you explain your STEM field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I use my skills to help people build an online presence so that they can reach the people that they want to help. I build websites and provide other services to help people make a good impression online. </p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>3.What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I was inspired by the work that I was doing in my first job and inspired by all of the new things that I was learning. I chose Tech because it felt right to me. It was where I felt like I could make the largest impact.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>4.What’s the best way to enter your field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">No matter what age you are right now there are ways that you can start getting in to tech and coding right now! There are lots of games and websites geared toward helping young people understand how to code and build the problem solving skills that they need to be successful at it.  Take some time to explore the websites and social media platforms that you are on everyday and learn a bit about how they are made. It will definitely amaze you!</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>5.What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Anything that you can access on the web right now was built by someone with a development or engineering skill set, Developers like me work each day to create the cool websites, software, games and social media platforms that we all know and love!</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>6.What keeps you going in your profession?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Keep a steady habit of learning is important and keeps me going. Also staying curious and wanting to push myself to create new and awesome things keeps me interested in what I do.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>7.What are your future career goals?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I would like to start my own organization where I help other women and people of color learn new tech skills for free where they can be placed in jobs that will give them new opportunities to learn a high paying skill.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>8.What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in stem?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">It can feel lonely at times. I am often the only woman of color in the spaces that I am in and it can feel isolating and discouraging. There is also things like imposter syndrome (not feeling like I belong or am qualified enough to do what I do) and the feeling that I have to prove myself to those around me more than everyone else does.  Those all can take a toll on you mentally and emotionally, which can make it tough to move forward sometimes.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>9.What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Stay curious and focused on your goals. Experiment and never be afraid to try new things.  I think there is a lot of pressure on young people to have their lives figured out before they entered the real world and I want whoever is reading to know &#8211; that’s not true! It will take time but keep chasing the things that fill you with joy and fire because those things will lead you to what is best for you!</p>



<p></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-normal-font-size">Hello! I&#8217;m Daisy and I&#8217;m an experimental quantum physics PhD candidate at the University of Surrey&#8217;s Advanced&nbsp;Technology Institute.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I&#8217;ve been interested in science for as long as I can remember, although I also have a passion for art and  was torn between pursuing art or science as a career. I eventually settled on science and opted to keep my creative pursuits as hobbies. What I&#8217;ve come to realise is that to be a scientist and a researcher you need to be creative so that side of me comes in handy when I&#8217;m solving problems and designing new experiments. Once I&#8217;d decided to do science I then had to decide which one! I knew I had more interest in the physical sciences and as physics was my favourite&nbsp;subject from when I was 16, I opted to do a physics degree.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">During the later years of high school, I had a lot of trouble with socialising and developed major depressive disorder and generalised anxiety disorder. It wasn&#8217;t until near the end of my degree that I was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and my challenges since high school began to make sense. I now have autism-specific support at my university and speak openly about the challenges and strengths of being autistic. During my degree, I had the opportunity to do a year of research for my master&#8217;s project so I applied to be a research and development intern at the Centre for Integrated Photonics where I worked on designing and testing semiconductor lasers for telecommunications applications. After graduating from my MPhys, I applied to do PhDs in quantum technologies and I started my PhD in 2018 working on a project on &#8216;development of InSb quantum point contacts for quantum technology applications&#8217;. I absolutely love my research and regularly talk about it as well as my experience as an autistic person in STEM and academia on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/notesfromthephysicslab/"><em>social media</em></a> and my <a href="https://www.notesfromthephysicslab.com/links"><em>blog</em></a>.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><em><strong>1.What is your specific area of STEM?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">My current sub-field is semiconductor spintronics. This falls under the larger field of quantum technologies. These fields are quite interdisciplinary with physicists, materials scientists, engineers and chemists all working within it. I approach my work from the perspective of experimental quantum physics, so I get to delve into the fundamental quantum physics phenomenon as well as looking at the fabrication and engineering side of things.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><em><strong>2.How would you explain your STEM field?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Semiconductor spintronics is a field which looks at exploiting electron spin in semiconductor materials for quantum technology applications. Let me break down all that jargon a bit: Semiconductors are a group of materials which can sometimes behave like a conductor and sometimes like an insulator. They have highly &#8216;tunable&#8217; properties and are the materials used in most technology these days. All of the transistors and other components in your phone and computer are made from predominantly semiconductor materials. They also make up a lot of the telecommunications infrastructure as semiconductors can be used to make lasers and other optical devices such as LEDs. Spintronics is short for &#8216;spin transport electronics&#8217; and it essentially is an extension of electronics. In electronics, we use the charge of electrons in materials to make technology and spintronics extends that to include an additional degree of freedom: spin. One of the most interesting applications of spintronics is in quantum computing where it is a key concept for solid-state electron spin qubits. My current research looks at ways to produce a current of electrons with a particular spin state using nanostructures made from semiconductor quantum wells which can be used to initialize&nbsp;spin-based qubits.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>3.What are some challenges you face in this field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">It&#8217;s a very new field so there are still lots of things we don&#8217;t know. But in a way, this is what makes it exciting! More generally, I have some challenges with my communication and processing differences due to being autistic but I&#8217;m developing great self-advocacy skills to enable me to work to the best of my ability (and this isn&#8217;t really a field-specific challenge, just more of a general life challenge).</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>4.What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">My decision to get into quantum physics comes from a class in high school. In chemistry, we were learning about electron shells in atoms and the concept of electron spin was mentioned. I instantly became fascinated with what this meant and asked my teacher who told me to ask a physics teacher. I did and since then had a fascination with quantum physics and the concept of spin. In fact, applied quantum physics is one of my longest-standing autistic &#8216;special interests&#8217; which is why I am so drawn to it as a career. I&#8217;ve also been very inspired by the incredible Emmy Noether since high school and find her to be such a role model for trailblazing women in physics and mathematics.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>5.What’s the best way to enter your field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I don&#8217;t think there is one particular &#8216;best&#8217; route for anything really. If you want to be a quantum physicist I do think you need a good grounding in physics&#8211; whether that is a degree or an apprenticeship (for example, the National Physical Laboratory offers science apprenticeships).&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>6.What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">There&#8217;s always so much amazing research coming out of quantum technology! Probably the most notable is the recent work from Google reaching &#8216;quantum supremacy&#8217;. Although there is a lot of hype around it, we still have a long way to go (decades probably) until we see anything resembling a functioning, commercially viable quantum computer.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>7.What keeps you going in your profession?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Knowing that I am part of the research effort towards new technologies which help advance progress in a whole host of disciplines.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>8.What are your future career goals?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I would like to be working in quantum technology R&amp;D, whether that is in academia or industry. I&#8217;d also like to develop my science communication freelance work so that I can help educate people on physics online as well as raise awareness about topics I&#8217;m passionate about such as making STEM more accessible to disabled people.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>9.What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I stick out within my research group due to my gender. I hope that in the future this isn&#8217;t the case but not many women progress to senior positions in physics and I&#8217;m very aware of that. Sometimes there are comments about my gender which strike me as odd because surely the most important thing about my academic work is the quality of my research, not my gender!</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>10.What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">If you have a passion for STEM then go for it. Contrary to stereotypes, you don&#8217;t need to be anything apart from curious, determined and have a thirst for knowledge to work in STEM fields!</p>



<p></p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size">Hi! My name is Shreya and I’m a full time backend software developer based in San Diego, California. I’m an active member of the Lean In Women In Tech community here and can be found speaking at the occasional tech event as an advocate for minorities in tech. Prior to this, I’ve worked at various corporations around the Silicon Valley in California. I hold a degree in bioinformatics from the University of California San Diego.</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size">1.<em><strong>What</strong></em> <strong><em>is your specific area of STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I work as a software engineer within the tech industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">2.<strong><em>What is the best way to enter your field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">One of the great things about software engineering is that there’s never just one way to do things! This includes breaking in. The most traditional option is to get a 4 year undergraduate degree in computer science and apply for software engineering internships along the way, culminating in a full time job as a software developer after college. But this definitely isn’t the only way! There are coding boot camps worth looking in to that teach the skills necessary to become a full-fledged software developer in just a few months. Yet another option is to use an online course platform such as Udemy to self-tech yourself programming and begin freelancing from there!&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">3.<strong><em>What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Software engineers work on every application on your phone! They work on your automated kitchen appliances and your home security system. Even when you’re going to get a drink at Starbucks, you’ve used applications spanning thousands of lines of code! From using your Maps app to get to the store to the application the cashier uses to punch in your order, you’re often using software everywhere without even realizing it!&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">4.<strong><em>What keeps you going in your profession?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Something that I love at my job is that every day is different. Every day I get to solve a new problem that no-one else has worked on before! The more complex the task, the greater feeling of accomplishment at the end of the day.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">5.<strong><em>What are your future career goals?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">As an advocate of minorities in tech, my goal within the tech community is to normalize and start discussions about difficult situations within the workplace. I try to empower others by providing potential solutions to these problems and provide a platform for others to build off of each other and connect.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">In general I divide my goal focuses by category: career, personal skills, financial, and health. My overarching theme for 2020 has been exploration. I’m trying to delve into new ideas with a more open mind.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">My career goals involve broadening my skillset technically as well as non-technically, translating to moving up the engineering ladder.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">6.<strong><em>What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in stem?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">It’s no secret that the odds are stacked up against women in STEM trying to build a successful career. One of the biggest challenges adding on to that is imposter syndrome. The way I define imposter syndrome is when one constantly and repeatedly doubts the legitimacy of their accomplishments and is worried that they don’t deserve to belong or succeed. I face this in waves, usually when in periods of great growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">7.<strong><em>What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">If I can suggest two virtues to develop, they would be clear communication and persistence — these have changed the game for my career and personal life. Just know that if you set your mind to it, you CAN and WILL succeed.</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size"><em><strong>1.What&#8217;s your story?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Born and raised in Dallas, TX, I quickly realized that you don’t have to go to a third world country to find people who lack basic necessities. My single mother put all of our needs before hers and after feeling a mass on her breast, she decided to ignore because who would pay for the doctor visit? Playing ball with my brother, a freak accident occurred and she was hit in the chest by the ball. The insane pain forced her to get checked and was notified of having breast cancer. This emotional incident gave my life a purpose- advocating for women&#8217;s health and well-being.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>2.What is your specific area of STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I am pursuing a medical degree, potentially in gynaecology.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>3.What does being a woman in STEM means to you?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">For me to be a woman in STEM means to be a leader in my community. I want to use my education and science for the betterment of the community.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>4.What are some really cool things you have had a chance to work on?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Working in research has been very fulfilling for me. I am a research assistant at the <em>Center For Global And Public Health </em>at <em>Southern Methodist University</em>, and I have worked on research involving HPV, cervical cancer, and breast cancer.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>5.What are your future career goals?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I aspire to develop a women’s health program in low income communities.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>6.What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">My message to anyone who wants to study is DO NOT BE AFRAID. You can do anything if you stay driven and determined. Your struggles will push you towards success.&nbsp;I have learned it&#8217;s OK to be afraid and to use that as a motivation. I definitely believe I can be a doctor, and so can you.</p>



<p></p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><em>1.What&#8217;s your story?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I developed keen interest in engineering from a very early age, so as soon as I got into senior high I took classes for computer science, only to realize I was actually interested in electronics! This is how I knew I wanted to become an electronics engineer. It was my dream to be a professor so I decided to do masters in the same. While pursuing masters I got an opportunity to become a teaching assistant. This helped me get some insight and teaching experience. But just when I thought everything was falling into place, I lost my sweet mother. I was mourning over her loss, juggling personal responsibilities and work to get a full-time teaching position at my university. It was one heck of a year but I thrived and became Assistant Professor at the same university. Now I get to do what I love everyday, teach.<img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><em>2. How would you explain your STEM field?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Electronics is one of the core engineering fields and it has been there since forever. It gives you an opportunity to understand the most important component or you can say, the heart of any device- processor. This field has a wide spectrum of topics like digital signalling, image processing, computer architecture and networks to name a few. If circuits and breadboards interests you, I think Electronics is waiting for you.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><em>3. What are some really cool things people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I am an engineer, but teaching has become my main profession. It is very satisfying to pass on the knowledge and help students become better engineers. Other than mentoring students, one of the cool things that we work on is research and data analysis of student&#8217;s progress. It helps us understand each student better and implement different techniques for achieving better results. It is interesting how every student is unique and needs a different approach.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><em>4. What does being a woman in STEM means to you?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I am aware of the gender discrimination in our field, but nothing is going to stop a woman with strong will to reach the heights she wants to. Being in STEM brings me immense joy and satisfaction and I would like to encourage women not only in STEM but any field to do anything that brings them happiness.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><em>5. What keeps you going?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I love sharing knowledge and I am lucky I get to do it every single day. I enjoy spending time with my students, teach them, learn from them. It&#8217;s like I am living my dream. I also believe in staying up to date with new technologies so currently I am learning about data science and machine learning.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><em>6. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">We are smart enough to make good choices for ourselves but not every person is lucky enough to get proper support or backing. Being a professor, I see a lot of young girls inclined towards STEM. I would still like to encourage more girls/women to take STEM and make their mark in this field. There is so much to do and so little of us. We need more women in STEM, so join us and help explore more. This field has so much to offer!</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size">Hi! My name is Mariana and I was born in Colombia. After my family and I survived one of the worst earthquakes in the Colombian history, we moved to Spain to start a new life. We faced struggles settling down but somehow managed to find a place to live and a spot for me in public school. One day, my mother showed me a news article about Dr Anna Veiga, the first scientist in Spain who succeeded in in-vitro fertilization, this urged me to become like her. I was 17 when I realized I wanted to be a medic and gave my best to become one. Unfortunately, I faced anxiety and panic attacks throughout my exams and contests that I participated for getting into medicine. One day, my mother showed me another news article: “ Bioinformatics, the Medicine of the Future”, this inspired me to my core. I recently graduated with a degree in Bioinformatics and currently studying MPhil in Medical Science at the University of Cambridge.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">1. <em>What is your specific area of STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Bioinformatics. It is the art of using computational resources in any scientific field (maths, physics, chemistry, biology and so on). For me, I chose to focus on Medical Sciences and stem cells &#8211; I am currently working at the Haematology department at the University of Cambridge, so the cells I am focused on are blood stem cells.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">2. <em>What goals do you have for the future?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">My short-term goals are to pursue a PhD at the University of Cambridge and to grow as a science communicator on social media to help others to fight for their dreams, especially in stem fields.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">3. <em>What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Our lab is divided between experimentalists and bioinformaticians, and we all work on Haematopoiesis (the study of blood cell types formation). The bioinformaticians work from mathematical models to machine learning and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis. In my case, I’m in the last group: I’m working on developing a computational pipeline for single-cell multimodal analysis (samples obtained using NGS)</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">4. <em>What keeps you going in your field?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I have loved studying stem cells since I was 17! Now I have the chance of using my “futuristic” bioinformatics skills in this field. It’s incredible to know I can keep learning everyday, don&#8217;t you think?</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">5. <em>What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in stem?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Though it is getting better, I still find it very difficult to see gender equality. There still are lack of women in STEM. I remember my first day at the Faculty of Informatics, there was a group of men sitting in the cafe and they whispered, “look, I bet she got lost” &#8211; they were talking about me! The worst mistake is to assume a woman is not capable of pursuing or being interested in STEM fields.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">6. <em>What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I would suggest them not listening to everything that people say. I have been psychologically attacked by narrow-minded people who kept saying that I should remember where I came from and stop dreaming about studying overseas. People have said that I cannot afford higher education in a foreign country, that I cannot get into medicine, and that maybe I should stop thinking about STEM fields. People have said that I am too young to leave home because it seems scary, I have heard them complain of me spending too much time studying instead of having fun (but they have no idea how fun I find my job!). I have experienced this so I can tell you that it’s your time to prove yourself and the world how STRONG you can be. Don’t stop, KEEP DREAMING.</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size">Hi, I am Urja and I am in the final year of dentistry. Choosing a field in medicine was the easiest decision of my life. I am a doctor and I enjoy helping people. Other than that, I am an ambivert and I love to party! I have a degree in Bharatnatyam, I was an athlete in school and still enjoy sports, and I am always up for learning new things. Thanks to quarantine, I learned to do digital art!</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>1.<em>How would you explain your stem field to young girls?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">We are the teeth doctors! We specialise in oral health and diagnose oral diseases. We create treatment plans for patients and help maintain or restore their oral health, we also take x-rays, monitor growth and development of teeth/jaws, and perform surgeries if necessary. In short, we help you keep your mouth happy.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>2</strong>.<strong> <em>Why did you choose your STEM field? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">My dad’s an Orthopaedic surgeon, watching him treat people and earn respect had an effect on me. Well, it was either that or MR’s gifts (just kidding). I decided to study MBBS but getting admission for medical is definitely not a piece of cake. Unfortunately, while I was preparing for my entrance, government changed rules and the admission process was going to be based solely on NEET. This was really important to me but at the same time I was running short on prep time. The pressure was real and unfortunately I got hit by anxiety. Long story short, I pushed through and got myself a nice seat for dentistry and I am enjoying this field ever since.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>3. </strong><em><strong>What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">What is usually the first thing you notice in a person? Smile. So I guess one of the coolest things that people in my profession do is smile designing. We also treat defects or disabilities that people are born with or get due to some disease. We assist in something known as “habit breaking”- believe me, it is exactly what it sounds like. We help patients break habits like thumb sucking, tongue thrusting and so on. And as a dentist, I am really proud of this last one- we promote anti-tabocco campaigns.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>4. </strong><em><strong>What keeps you going in your profession?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I strongly believe that one of the worst pains in human body is tooth ache, so it makes me happy to offer my help for relieving that pain. It warms my heart when I see a smile back on my patient’s faces. My work gives me tremendous satisfaction and my happy patients is what keeps me going.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>5. </strong><em><strong>What goals do you have for the future?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">A lot of people even in the developed countries ignore dental health. I would really like to spread awareness about importance of dental hygiene and help avoid the risk of diseases like oral cancer.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>6. <em>What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Smile changes how a person is pursued. It plays a vital role in developing one’s personality and yet people underestimate the power of oral health. But guess what, we are here for them. As a dentist you can help people look good and spread awareness about dental hygiene. Help us spread smiles <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

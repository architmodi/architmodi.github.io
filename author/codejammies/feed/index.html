										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p style="font-size:22px;">The internet has 3 layers to it- the surface web, the deep web, and the dark web.‚Å£<br>‚Å£<br>The surface web is where the interests of most users lie and are accessible to everyone. This layer is what you use regularly to surf information, access social media or emails. But surface web only comprises 4% of the internet body. So where‚Äôs the rest at?‚Å£<br>‚Å£<br>The deep web, as the name suggests is below the surface and stores data that is hidden from our conventional internet. It holds more personal information, the type of information that requires user credentials and is not available openly to everybody, such as personal email accounts, social media accounts, bank accounts, academic reports, databases, medical and legal documents to give you a gist.‚Å£<br>‚Å£<br>And the layer you‚Äôve been waiting for, the dark web. As the name suggests, it can get pretty dark so better to stay away. Both deep and dark web pages are not indexed and therefore are not accessible through regular search engines like google. This part of the web contains harmless as well as harmful content. Hackers may steal your personal information and sell it to people on the dark web. So what to do when something like this happens to you? If you find your emails or passwords on this layer of the internet, here are a few things you could do to limit the harm-‚Å£<br>‚Å£<br><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f6e1.png" alt="üõ°" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Step up your password game- use a strong password and change it frequently.‚Å£<br>‚Å£<br><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f6e1.png" alt="üõ°" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />If the email address found on the dark web is associated with confidential accounts or bank accounts, alert the appropriate people and change email ids.‚Å£<br>‚Å£<br><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f6e1.png" alt="üõ°" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Avoid using public or unsecured wifi.‚Å£<br>‚Å£<br><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f6e1.png" alt="üõ°" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Use 2-factor authentication.‚Å£<br>‚Å£<br><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f6e1.png" alt="üõ°" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Stay away from unsecured websites. Do not open links in emails that are not TLS encrypted.‚Å£</p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-large-font-size">With growing use of phones and laptops, all tech users need to be aware of these 3 health conditions and be mindful of bodily sensations and best practices.</p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#da2626;"><em>Disclaimer- Do not rely on the symptoms and remedies mentioned in this article. Please visit your doctor to get a better understanding of your situation!!</em></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-large-font-size">1. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</p>



<p class="has-large-font-size">Numb or tingly feeling in the hand, wrist, or forearm caused due to a pinched nerve in the wrist. This condition can be easily prevented but interestingly around 3 mil people in the US experience this every year.‚Å£</p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-large-font-size">Symptoms: Pain in hand/wrist/arm, pins and needle sensation, weakness in hand.</p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-large-font-size">Home Remedies: Gentle massage in the pain area, taking period breaks, recommended wrist and finger stretches.</p>



<p class="has-large-font-size"></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-attachment-id="1415" data-permalink="https://architmodi.github.io/carpal/" data-orig-file="https://codejammies.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/carpal.png" data-orig-size="624,610" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="carpal" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://codejammies.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/carpal.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://codejammies.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/carpal.png?w=624" src="https://codejammies.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/carpal.png" alt="Getty image" class="wp-image-1415" /><figcaption>Getty Image</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-large-font-size">2. Smart Phone Pinky</p>



<p class="has-large-font-size">You are more likely to use the pinky finger to hold the weight of your smartphone. An average person spends about 5-7 hours browsing on phone, causing the pinky to bend and become slimmer than the other one.‚Å£</p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-large-font-size">Symptoms: Stiffness and pain in the pinky finger, cramps on holding the phone for an elongated period, slimmer appearance, clicking sound, numbness.</p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-large-font-size">Home Remedies: Avoid using the pinky finger to balance the cellphone device, apply ice pack or heat pad when in pain.</p>



<p class="has-large-font-size"></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="1417" data-permalink="https://architmodi.github.io/pinky/" data-orig-file="https://codejammies.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/pinky.jpg" data-orig-size="634,645" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;\u00a9 AP&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="pinky" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://codejammies.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/pinky.jpg?w=295" data-large-file="https://codejammies.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/pinky.jpg?w=634" src="https://codejammies.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/pinky.jpg?w=634" alt="" class="wp-image-1417" srcset="https://codejammies.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/pinky.jpg 634w, https://codejammies.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/pinky.jpg?w=147 147w, https://codejammies.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/pinky.jpg?w=295 295w" sizes="(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" /><figcaption>Getty Image</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-large-font-size">3. Tech/Text Neck</p>



<p class="has-large-font-size">Head forward, shoulders rounded and back slumped. If I just defined your ‚Äúnormal‚Äù posture, you might be on your way to experiencing tech neck!‚Å£</p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-large-font-size">Symptoms: Stiff neck, pain through shoulder to arm, headaches, muscular pain, soreness in neck/arm/shoulder, backpain.</p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-large-font-size">Home Remedies: Regular neck movement, mindful of neck and back posture, massage, ice packs.</p>



<p class="has-large-font-size"></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="1418" data-permalink="https://architmodi.github.io/techneck/" data-orig-file="https://codejammies.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/techneck.png" data-orig-size="880,312" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="techneck" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://codejammies.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/techneck.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://codejammies.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/techneck.png?w=880" src="https://codejammies.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/techneck.png?w=880" alt="" class="wp-image-1418" srcset="https://codejammies.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/techneck.png 880w, https://codejammies.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/techneck.png?w=150 150w, https://codejammies.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/techneck.png?w=300 300w, https://codejammies.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/techneck.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /><figcaption>Getty Image</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p class="has-large-font-size">These conditions are common, painful, yet could be easily prevented by making subtle changes to your postures, neck positions, and introducing stretches and ergonomic tools like ergo mice, chairs, laptop stands, mousepads, etc. into your lifestyle. ‚Å£<br>‚Å£<br>Speaking of unhealthy habits, I hold my phone too close to my face and use the pinky finger to balance its weight. And I‚Äôm starting to notice how my right pinky looks slimmer than the left one. What about you?</p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#a30003;"><em>1.  How would you describe your role?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a PhD candidate, I work on a specific project that I have chosen for around 3/4 years full-time. My project investigates eye-gaze in the process of joint attention. To do this, I am using a virtual reality headset (HTC Vive Pro Eye) and electroencephalography (EEG), which is a method of measuring neural activity, by recording the electrical signals on the scalp.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#a30003;"><em>2. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Interestingly, I wasn‚Äôt inspired by anyone to go into STEM. As we know, Black women in STEM are underrepresented, and so, not being able to see people who like me in the field may have played a role in that. While I was very much interested in science, I was unsure how to pursue it exactly. I was lucky enough to have a supervisor who cared enough to push me towards my academic abilities and to aim higher in my goals. Having that support is incredibly important. I would encourage anyone who is interested to find yourself mentors to help you along the journey.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#a30003;"><em>3. What‚Äôs the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I don‚Äôt think there is a ‚Äúbest‚Äù way of entering the field of neuroscience because it is so interdisciplinary. Depending on what type of science you like, you can almost always link it into neuroscience if you want to! For example, physicists can look at brain imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), whereas biologists utilise neurons at the cellular level and can research neuron firing patterns in particular disorders and/or conditions.<br>A skill that I highly recommend to everyone is coding. In my opinion, learning how to code to create experiments (e.g. in VR) or analyse data (brain imaging methods) is key in building a successful career, not only in neuroscience but in many other STEM fields if you decide you want to change. It provides you with a lot of freedom and opportunities.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#a30003;"><em>4. What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">A cool project that was completed in the lab, looked at the process of decision making in police officers. When coming face to face with a potential criminal, police officers are tasked with deciding the threat level of an individual. This informs their decision on how to react to the scenario and the neural responses of this were measured using EEG. Virtual reality offers you a safe space and a controlled environment to practice these scenarios. And so, the possibilities on where we take this collaboration of virtual environments and neuroimaging is arguably endless.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#a30003;"><em>5. What is it like to be a woman in STEM? What are some challenges that you have faced?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Being a woman in STEM is difficult and being a Black woman in STEM holds additional difficulties. It is important to have a network of people who understand this and create a safe space where you can discuss and work through these difficulties in a healthy way. Some communities that I am a part of in the U.K. are the <a href="https://www.acrcollective.com/">African-Caribbean Research Collective</a> (Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/ACRC_UK">@ACRC_UK</a>) and&nbsp; the <a href="https://www.phdhive.co.uk/">PhDHive</a>.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#a30003;"><em>6. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Anyone who is reading this maybe thinking about going into science as a career, I want you to know that you are supported. There are online communities out there who have similar interests to you, and who you can have long discussions with about the subject. Utilize social media, and in particular Twitter ‚Äì there have been a lot of movements to build communities of people in these spaces, check out hashtags with your area of interest, for example: #BlackInNeuro, #BlackInCancer, #BlackInAstro and #BlackBirders. Most importantly, I want you to know that there will be some tough days and that is okay. Some days you will not want to hear anything science-related, and that‚Äôs okay too. Go at your own pace, make great friends along the way and enjoy as much of it as you can.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am a second year Cancer Research UK PhD student researching how to improve treatment for colorectal cancer. Specifically, I am looking at a protein KDM6a and researching why deleting this gene in mice prolongs survival.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">A PhD is notoriously stressful and time consuming. However, during lockdown the pace of my PhD drastically slowed down which gave me time to stop and reflect what it is I love about science. I realized what I love is breaking down complex topics into bitesize chunks that anyone could understand &#8211; and from this realization I launched my Instagram account ‚Äò<a href="https://www.instagram.com/ella_explains/">@ella_explains</a>‚Äô. With this Instagram I hope to make science accessible to everyone.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Something that is hugely important to me is work life balance. Research can very easily become all consuming so I make a huge effort to be very efficient while I work to maximize the time I have away from the lab. It‚Äôs very easy to become overwhelmed by the enormity of the research. In my spare time I ride my horses, spend time with friends, family (and of course my dog) and generally find other creative outlets.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>1. What is your specific area of STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I work in cancer stem cell research. Stem cells are cells which are able to change themselves into multiple different cell types. Tumors contain some of these stem cells and what makes them tricky is that these stem cells are resistant to cancer treatments we have at the moment. That means when you give a person a cancer treatment most of the tumor dies, except for the stem cells, and because they can turn into multiple other cell types they can reform a tumor. I am looking at trying to understand these stem cells better in the hope that we can make cancer treatment better.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>2. What are some challenges you have faced in this research?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Working in research is like trying to solve a puzzle &#8211; which means mentally it can be quite draining. Sometimes I find it very difficult to leave my research at the door when I go home in the evening so I get a bit stressed out and burnt out as a result. Hopefully I will get better at this!&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>3. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I chose to be a biologist because it was the subject I found the most interesting at school. However, the field is so vast that I spent a lot of time stressing about which part of biology I wanted to study. I chose to go to The University of Edinburgh because it had so many different undergraduate courses which enabled me to change my mind easily &#8211; which I did &#8211; 3 times! I settled on Stem Cell biology and fell in love with it &#8211; stem cells are incredible.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>4. What‚Äôs the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I think if you have the drive to be a research scientist you will get there. The most important thing is to have a hard working attitude which will get you a place in a lab. Classically most people start with a masters and move on to a PhD after that &#8211; but neither of these are essential. I was super lucky and my supervisor was so pleased with the data from my undergraduate project I was employed as a technician to continue the work. This gave me very valuable experience meaning I never had to do a masters before my PhD. A PhD wasn&#8217;t the only option however, you can remain working in a lab without one and work up to positions such as lab manager.&nbsp;<br />I think in order to do a PhD you have to be very determined &#8211; it&#8217;s a tough process that can be very demanding at times &#8211; but very rewarding in the long run! Unlike a university degree which is lots of memorizing information research involves having to explore one tiny aspect of science in very fine detail &#8211; meaning it is nothing like the degree! I think having a creative mind is often an asset to a researcher where you are designing experiments and devising solutions to problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>5. What keeps you going in your research? What‚Äôs next for your career?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Research is very demanding both in time and mental capacity. So I think it‚Äôs really important to keep reminding yourself of the bigger picture. Ultimately my research could help save lives &#8211; so that is a major factor that keeps me going. At the moment I don‚Äôt think I will continue my career in research. However, I hope to delve into the world of science communication but I am also keeping an open mind as I may enter a new field entirely. Research is teaching me so many life skills which would help me in any future career I choose.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>6. What is it like to be a woman in STEM? What are some challenges that you have faced?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are distinctly more men in my office than there are women and additionally an even smaller percentage of these women occupy principle investigator roles. I think young people are often inspired by imaging themselves in roles those around them occupy and a lack of females means a lot of girls can‚Äôt imagine themselves in these roles. However, I do believe the tide is turning on this and with help from projects like #STEMUp we will have more diversity in STEM.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>7. What are 3 things that you wish could change about STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I would like STEM to be a little less intense &#8211; it is possible to advance your career and have a life outside of your STEM field.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I would make STEM more diverse &#8211; and I am hopeful this will happen in time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I would like the ‚Äòpressure to publish papers‚Äô to be relaxed &#8211; and for research to be considered more of a journey than just a mission to publish papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>8. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">When I was at school I was fortunate enough to have speakers come in and tell me about their STEM field. This enabled me to understand the range of jobs that were out there. This is why I now run a science communication Instagram as an attempt to make science more accessible and less intimidating for everyone. I think more initiatives like this is the best way to promote more women into STEM.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>9. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Don‚Äôt be intimidated by the STEM fields, don‚Äôt think they are just for ‚Äòsmart‚Äô people. STEM fields are for hard working people who want to make a difference in the world &#8211; so if you are interested &#8211; go for it.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hi, my name is Ea, and I am a first year PhD candidate studying Applied Biological Chemistry at Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology (TUAT). I did undergrad in Chemistry from Visayas State University in Leyte, Philippines and Master‚Äôs degree in Agriculture from TUAT. As a PhD candidate I am working on glycoproteins found in central nervous system. Funny story, as I take hundreds of photos of the brain, I was inspired to convert these pictures into art as a project called Experiments in Art (EA). With this I hope to start a trend where artists use science as inspiration and scientists can look at their work in a different way.</p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>1. How would you describe your role?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I study glycans (polysaccharides), specifically those that bonds to glycoproteins. With the help of different chemical tools that we have developed in the lab, we study how these glycoproteins change in the brain especially in the node of Ranvier, which are unmyelinated regions in the axon that are important for fast conduction of nerve impulses.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>2. What are some challenges you have faced in this research?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I grew up in Leyte, Philippines so as much as the environment was nurturing for my growth as a student there weren‚Äôt enough opportunities like exposure to other  scientists or science programs as there are in Manila or some place else. The research opportunities were limited as the labs were not fully advanced, and for students in the province it is a big hindering factor that majority of the programs supported on media and private companies are only in Manila. And now that I&#8217;m in Japan working on my PhD, language barrier is proving to be a challenge since I spend a lot of time in Japanese laboratory. However, my lab mates and professor are very supportive, so this helps me cope with this challenge.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>3. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Funny you should ask, because both my parents are scientists. My dad is a Biochemist and my mom is a Soil Scientist. Growing up I was always exposed to science and my first experiment was making antibacterial soap with my dad using flowers near my school for an elementary science fair. We won first place. Personally, I think it was definitely a way for me and my dad to bond, and my mom was also very supportive so it wasn‚Äôt hard to fall in love with the field.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I would say the biggest influence were definitely be my parents, followed by my high school and elementary science teachers. First time I heard ‚Äúmolecular biology‚Äù was freshmen year in high school and I just remember being so amazed with that word. I didn‚Äôt pursue the major during college but now with my work as a biological chemistry PhD candidate, I‚Äôm using molecular biology techniques.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">To sum this up, I love working in the lab, and I also loved researching as a kid..so this and support from my folks and university proved to be very influential for me in choosing this very STEM discipline.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>4. What‚Äôs the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are multiple ways of entering this field so I am not quite sure which one&#8217;s the best. I was fortunate enough to grow up in a family that is in academia. Both my parents are professors and my dad is in the same field as me. For grade school, I did experiments on antibacterial soap using flowers near my school, in high school I studied about proteolytic properties of local plant species and how it can be related to Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, in undergrad I was a Chemistry major and my thesis was on the alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity of indigenous plant species in the Philippines and how it can be related to Diabetes.&nbsp;So I guess what I am trying to say here is that I was exposed to lab environment at a very young age and my parents supported me in every step which I think played a big role and that encouraged me to work hard and aim for higher education. Since I am still very new in my career I am not yet fit to say what it takes to be successful but based on what I&#8217;ve learned so far, grit and perseverance paired with curiosity and creativity goes a long way. One might face failures and frustrating moments on a regular basis but the best thing to do is to just scratch that mistake and go back to the drawing board.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>5. What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We work on cell biology, elucidating protein crystal structure using X-ray crystallography (super cool technique that allows us to see the 3D structure of a protein and how it interacts with different molecules), brain research, genome editing, modifying proteins so they are expressed more which is important in medicine, food, and fuel industries.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>6. What keeps you going in your research? What‚Äôs next for your career?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are a lot of things that helps me to keep going in my research but to name a few, a supportive lab group, interesting research topic, and of course full scholarship definitely plays a big role.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">After my PhD, I am eyeing on going back to Philippines to help develop STEM fields in the country and to strengthen the collaboration between Filipino and Japanese universities.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>7. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Grit, willingness to learn, hard work, confidence and relationships that we build with people can help us move forward in STEM. There may be less women in STEM right now but that should not discourage us from being in the field. The advantage of being&nbsp;less in number is that it means there are still many spaces to fill, and as a woman in STEM, I encourage you girls to fill that space! Collaboration is key, for men and women alike. As long as we keep this in mind, we can build a symbiotic relationship with men and I hope this encourages us girls to share our ideas knowing that our thoughts as women are very much needed. A raise of the hand in a conference, an e-mail to a professor stating your intention to work in lab, writing that application letter, googling &#8220;scholarships for developing countries&#8221;, picking one that is applicable to you, asking your colleagues to help you apply for grad school. Sometimes the guts to initiate is all it takes to get into STEM.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>8. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Past generations have worked hard to provide women a platform to be visible and heard in STEM and related fields. There is no need to be intimidated anymore. If you feel like STEM is something you want to pursue, go for it! Find a role model or be your own. The perspective of a woman is important in STEM not only for representation but because our brains can offer insights that will compliment that of men, and this is important for the progression of knowledge and learning.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">I always knew I loved science, but I wasn‚Äôt always sure how I wanted to pursue it. I went to Saint Mary‚Äôs College for a degree in Chemistry, fully intending on going pre-med and becoming a doctor. That is, until I became a TA for a nursing chemistry course and the instructor gave me more responsibility. I *loved* teaching content using nursing contexts. The instructor and my advisor pulled me aside and told me they saw something in me- and that I should really consider adding educating others to my plans. I still loved bench chemistry, so I worked to get trained in education and chemistry, and applied for master‚Äôs programs. I accepted a fellowship at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) that placed me in Chicago Public Schools as part of a program to develop better communication between scientists and the public. This coupled with a sudden illness that resulted in brain surgery (better now!), my goals shifted, and I decided that life was too short to not pursue my dreams of being an educator.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">After getting my Master‚Äôs in Chemistry, I enrolled in the newly minted Learning Science program at UIC where I was the first to earn a Ph.D. Throughout my program I worked with teachers as part of professional development programs and in designing curricular materials. I noticed that I really enjoyed the ‚Äúcreating a product‚Äù and seeing direct results component of the work, rather than developing new theories. After working on the Connected Chemistry Curriculum project, I became an assessment specialist at the American Institutes for Research‚Äîand this is where I found a second love: Assessment writing.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">After years in assessment, I left and started my own consulting practice, Ryan Education Consulting LLC, where I develop curricular material and write assessment items. And I couldn‚Äôt love it more! During this time, I also pursued a passion project of becoming a children‚Äôs book author. After having my son, I wrote <em>Let‚Äôs Learn about Chemistry</em> and it was published in June 2020.</p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em><strong>1. How would you describe your job/role?</strong></em><br>I work with stakeholders to develop curricular materials and assessments. Some days that means I get to read through science journals and news media to find unique contexts- and those are my favorite days! I write materials that help scaffold knowledge in the ways that people learn, and with that assessments that give a picture into their understandings. Another hat I wear is that of a science communicator. I work with others to help people find the science in their everyday and to make it less daunting! During COVID19 social distancing times, I have been very active on my Instagram account, sharing activities that I do with my son.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>2. What are some challenges you have faced in this field?</em></strong><br>When I first started after my PhD I faced an opinion that ‚ÄúI just got out of school‚Äù and that I was green, despite my years of experience during my Ph.D. program and postdoc. To people outside academia, they didn‚Äôt understand that I was managing large scale projects, and this wasn‚Äôt anything new to me. It was almost as though I had to prove myself even more, that yes, I belonged here.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>3. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong><br>I chose the Learning Sciences because I wanted to learn more about how people learned chemistry. I wanted to think of ways that we can teach chemistry better, so that we don‚Äôt hear ‚ÄúOh, I hated chemistry in school‚Äù so often. As a society, so many of us fear science or don‚Äôt understand it. This can lead to mistrust of scientists or the extreme opposite of blindly following someone who says they are a scientist, without critically thinking about what they are saying. It has always been my goal to make science accessible for everyone and to help us become more informed citizens of the world.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>4. What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong><br>A learning sciences degree opens so many doors that it is difficult to list all of the cool things people do with them! People design new technologies for learning, identify issues in education and design solutions, conduct research to determine mental models that students have when working through a problem, design assessments and curricular materials, etc. The field itself is interdisciplinary‚Äîso people work across domains and across sectors to find solutions.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>5. What are 3 things that you wish could change about STEM?</em></strong><br>I would change the narrative of what it means to be a scientist. When I first got into the field, I remember the ‚ÄúDraw a Scientist‚Äù activity, where students often drew a white male with a lab coat. It warms my heart to see trends shifting, at least in the classrooms when I‚Äôve done this activity, that they draw themselves, one even drew herself wearing JUICY sweats. Being a scientist is for everyone, and everyone who wants to be a scientist can be. It is not just for white men! There are so many initiatives out there that I think help with this. Another thing I would change is the way we teach science, and granted, I think this shift is currently happening. Rather than teaching science as a book of facts, we need to teach it like a tool to help us find answers to our burning questions. If we teach it this way, then when we find new information that changes a recommendation, such as wearing masks, the general population won‚Äôt think that scientists don‚Äôt know what they are doing. They will understand that this is real science, a continually shifting body of knowledge that updates with new data. Finally, I would change the ‚Äúweed-out‚Äù course structure. This is such a leak in the STEM pipeline and so many passionate future scientists are lost through this leak.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>6. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></strong><br>Showing girls what real scientists look like will help them stay in STEM. When I was in graduate school, I would hear ‚ÄúOh you don‚Äôt look like a scientist‚Äù and I was of a generation where I took that as a compliment. Looking back, I cringe when I think of that. I should have asked, ‚ÄúWhy not? What does a scientist look like and do in your mind?‚Äù Showing girls that you can be girly and into makeup and still like science or that you can have blue hair and work at NASA is so important. There are some amazing Instagram accounts that focus on this&#8212; showing real women in their real lives as scientists and at home.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>7. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Always consider every opportunity. You never know where it might take you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In high school I took an AP Psychology course that sparked my interest in understanding human cognition. I was particularly interested in what happens during our early years and how that shapes who we become as adults. During my freshmen year of undergrad, I enrolled in a philosophy course on Contemporary Moral Issues that inadvertently began my interest into interdisciplinary studies. As a Psychology major minoring in Neuroscience and Philosophy, I found a unexpected amount of overlap in content that encouraged me to incorporate concepts from unrelated courses in order to answer questions and engage in discussions on cognition. In the semesters that followed, I implemented what I had learned in my Contemporary Moral Issues class as a reminder of the guiding principles and biases that result from an individual‚Äôs personal history that can later show through in their research and academic endeavors. I also applied this lesson to my own thinking, so that I could try to minimize my own biases and be as open as possible in my studies.</p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>1. How would you describe your role?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am currently a Cognitive Science PhD Candidate at Brown University. In this role I take courses, conduct research, and work as a teaching assistant for undergrad classes. I am also the Educational Research Lead for the upcoming Katsuiku Academy in Tokyo, Japan. In this role I apply current research to policy and practice. I work with the team to develop a research-based curriculum that hopes to educate and nurture high school students in preparation for the future.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>2. What are some challenges you have faced in this research?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Valuation of this work and its wide-reaching broader impact. People oftentimes dismiss ‚Äúsoft‚Äù science fields and do not see the rigor and importance of the contributions we make.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>3. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I chose Cognitive Science because it allowed me to utilize methods and theories from fields outside of my department such as Education and Economics to answer questions about cognition.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>4. What‚Äôs the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The best way to enter the field is to familiarize yourself with it‚Äôs associated fields. Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind (i.e., cognition). It combines methods and theories from fields such as psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, and computer science etc. Skills that are important for building a successful career include an understanding of research methods, statistical analysis, coding languages, and computational modeling. For those that are interested in conducting research, additional experience in research traditional research methods like surveying and interviews, as well neuroimaging techniques (e.g. fMRI, EEG, fNIRS etc.) are invaluable.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>5. What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The most exciting/flashy thing people in my profession work on is artificial intelligence and machine learning. This includes self-driving cars, virtual reality simulation, and robotic companions for elderly people. Understanding how the brain processes information and executes actions allows us to reproduce these abilities in machines.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>6. What keeps you going in your research? What‚Äôs next for your career?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Improving the condition and future for Black and brown children. Although I am not sure of what exactly I will be doing, I hope to continue academic and social programming consulting and research to support children at the margins.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>7. What is it like to be a woman in STEM? What are some challenges that you have faced?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Being a woman in STEM is like being a woman in any part or sector of life. There is predisposition for men and even other women to dismiss or give passing acknowledgement to you as a scientist. This is exacerbated when you hold a BIPOC identity. It is important to ground yourself in why you are taking on these hurdles/challenges. Without this, imposter syndrome and stereotype threat can prevent you from reaching your full potential.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>8. What are 3 things that you wish could change about STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Barriers to access to STEM education and opportunities for BIPOC people that are present as early as childhood.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The myth of meritocracy-based advancement in academia. It is not the case that advancement is solely based on hard work, talent, and good scientific practice.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Blind trust and belief in past scientific research that is rooted in racism and oppression.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>9. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Self-advocacy. Getting the resources and mentorship you need, and ultimately getting to where you want to be career wise is dependent on advocating for yourself. I attended a large public university for my undergraduate degree, and I curated my ideal experience by seeking out help and opportunities. Sometimes that meant not going to the most obvious people (e.g. program counselors) because I didn‚Äôt fit the mold of a student that they perceived as successful.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Many times, people tell you to figure out what you want to do, but they don‚Äôt mention half the battle. You have to figure out what you‚Äôre not interested in to figure out what your passions and purpose is. I have worked in multiple labs and taken course work in various fields. Many of them weren‚Äôt for me, but those experiences allowed me to narrow down my interests and strengths.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>10. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Your unique experience and perspective are invaluable. Don‚Äôt be afraid to pour your personal self into your professional life. It could be the difference between novel contributions and self-actualization or going along just to get along.</p>



<p></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">My name is Alex and I am a scientist on my journey to get a PhD in Materials Science at the<br />Institute of Metallurgy and Materials Science in the Polish Academy of Sciences! I love a<br />good challenge, and my PhD provides plenty.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">For my Masters I specialized in ceramic materials, writing my Master thesis based on<br />research performed during an internship at the CEA in France. For my PhD I decided that I<br />needed a change and now my work focuses on metals with gallium.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I wholeheartedly believe in the power of science communication and in my free time I love<br />talking about science and I hope to inspire people to see Materials Science as the amazing<br />field that it is!</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>1. How would you describe your role?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Right now, I am a last year PhD student (I plan to defend my thesis in June 2021) at an Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Cracow. However, my favorite way to describe myself is young scientist! I love my job because I get to do a little bit of everything &#8211; I am writing my thesis, managing funding, publishing, leading my own project, working as the vice president of the student council, preparing for scientific stay in the US, and in my free time I love to talk about science!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>2. What are some challenges you have faced in this research?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Anxiety and imposter syndrome are two challenges that I am still working on. I believe the best way to overcome problems is facing them, which is why I always try to push myself to do things outside of my comfort zone.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am currently leading a project concerning nanomaterials. The whole process from writing the proposal, getting the funding to actually doing the research has been an equally amazing and terrifying adventure. Being in charge is extremely gratifying but also requires being prepared for the unexpected.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>3. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My journey into STEM was‚Ä¶ a bumpy one. In school I liked math, physics and chemistry‚Ä¶ but it wasn‚Äôt reciprocated. Even though we had a complicated relationship, my fascination with STEM began in school, when I almost didn‚Äôt pass physics class and was made to prepare a presentation about black holes. I started reading a lot of books and I just got hooked on. (We‚Äôre made of star stuff?! The Universe is how old?! A teaspoonful of a neutron star would weigh a billion tons?!). The less I understood, the more information I craved. Even though it took me a lot of work and effort, I‚Äôve managed to work on my math and chemistry and decided to go into STEM.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I chose Materials Engineering for my Engineer and Master Degrees as I was looking for something connected with chemistry, but at the same time I wanted that sweet, sweet engineer title. Materials Engineering seemed fun and challenging and that‚Äôs how I am were I am today!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>4. What‚Äôs the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Materials Science is a fascinating field that combines chemistry, physics and a lot of engineering and if you want to pursue a scientific career and/or a PhD in it, you should start with choosing the right path at the university. Studying Materials Science or Materials Engineering is a great way to start but it‚Äôs not the only way! I have friends who are pursuing a PhD in Materials Science, although they have a master‚Äôs in physics, chemistry, bioengineering, electronics or metallurgy. This often gives them a unique perspective on the world of Materials Science.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Other than choosing the right studies, the most important thing is to learn to take (calculated) risks (which I‚Äôm pretty sure applies to all fields in STEM!). Think big, don‚Äôt be afraid ‚Äì apply for internships and apprenticeships (especially ones that are abroad ‚Äì there are many ways to fund those!), ask professors if you can help in the lab, look for mentors (there are a lot of mentorships programs in different STEM fields), join societies or science clubs (it‚Äôs an awesome way to meet people and work on those soft skills). Get as much of various experiences as you can and stay curious!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>5. What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Everything around us is made from materials ‚Äì so materials science touches our lives in every possible way. Personally, I work on metals that are liquid at room temperature (just like mercury, however in my case those metals are nontoxic and safe to handle). But people in Materials Science work on all kinds of cool materials and technologies like aerogels (materials literally made from up to 99.8% of nothing), breathable liquids (liquids, that can have so much oxygen dissolved in them that you would actually be able to breathe in them) or shape memory alloys (those are metals that can change shape if for example the temperature changes!).</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>6. What keeps you going in your research? What‚Äôs next for your career?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">What keeps me going is the challenge and the opportunity to try new things, go to new places, and meet new people. I put a lot of effort and time into my research because I have fun and I love what I do!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">What‚Äôs next? I am not sure yet! I have a few months left in my PhD and although (despite its many problems) I love academia, I would love trying to flirt a bit with industry. At the moment I‚Äôve secured funding for 3 months stay at University College London after my PhD, and I am actively looking for new opportunities!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>7. What is it like to be a woman in STEM? What are some challenges that you have faced?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Materials Science is a STEM fields where there are a lot of women (at least when it comes to students &#8211; it gets worse after getting a PhD). Last year in Poland almost 48% of materials engineering students were female. The data however does not lie ‚Äì at the grad school level almost the same amount of men and women get funding (for projects, grants and scholarships), however the proportion changes the higher the step in the career is (for example in Poland, for a grant dedicated only for professors, only 8% of the grants were awarded to woman).</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>8. What are 3 things that you wish could change about STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f5e3.png" alt="üó£" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Open access to science ‚Äì the process of publishers getting all the money, while the authors and reviewers don‚Äôt see a penny out of it and then the readers have then to pay for it horrendous amounts of money‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not okay. Science should be accessible to all.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f5e3.png" alt="üó£" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Communicating science to the public ‚Äì the public doesn‚Äôt really understand how science works (the misconceptions about Covid-19, are just another proof of that) and we, as scientist and people in STEM, are not doing enough to change that. We don‚Äôt talk about how we do science; we don‚Äôt try to explain our results in an understandable way, we just don‚Äôt talk to the people who very often are the ones paying for the research through their taxes.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f5e3.png" alt="üó£" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Mental health in STEM ‚Äì there is often a very unhealthy culture in STEM (it will depend on the place, the group and the people but it happens more often than not), forcing people to work long hours, not take breaks and just keep comparing yourself to others. Studies show that the mental health of a lot of PhD students is not the best (in Nature PhD Survey 2019, 36% of students reported that they have sought help for anxiety or depression caused by their PhD studies!) and that is something that should be addressed.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>9. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am not an expert in the field (however there is some scientific research done concerning the topic and I would love to learn more) but what would have personally helped me was to not treat science as a gendered issue. Boys are shown how cars work, for girls it happens much less often. Teachers and parents often assume that boys should be able to repair things or solve computers problems, automatically sending a signal to girls that they don‚Äôt need to have that knowledge. We buy boys a lot of cool, science-y toys, and we buy girls dolls, and we expect the kids to form the same interests. Hand on experience with science and technology would have helped me, personally, when I was younger.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>10. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Being a scientist is a viable career option and it allows you to learn new stuff every day, travel the world and push the limits of the Unknown. It‚Äôs not going to be easy, but it will be worth it. If you‚Äôre curious and willing to work hard, you can do it!</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">I always knew I loved science, but I wasn’t always sure how I wanted to pursue it. I went to Saint Mary’s College for a degree in Chemistry, fully intending on going pre-med and becoming a doctor. That is, until I became a TA for a nursing chemistry course and the instructor gave me more responsibility. I *loved* teaching content using nursing contexts. The instructor and my advisor pulled me aside and told me they saw something in me- and that I should really consider adding educating others to my plans. I still loved bench chemistry, so I worked to get trained in education and chemistry, and applied for master’s programs. I accepted a fellowship at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) that placed me in Chicago Public Schools as part of a program to develop better communication between scientists and the public. This coupled with a sudden illness that resulted in brain surgery (better now!), my goals shifted, and I decided that life was too short to not pursue my dreams of being an educator.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">After getting my Master’s in Chemistry, I enrolled in the newly minted Learning Science program at UIC where I was the first to earn a Ph.D. Throughout my program I worked with teachers as part of professional development programs and in designing curricular materials. I noticed that I really enjoyed the “creating a product” and seeing direct results component of the work, rather than developing new theories. After working on the Connected Chemistry Curriculum project, I became an assessment specialist at the American Institutes for Research—and this is where I found a second love: Assessment writing.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">After years in assessment, I left and started my own consulting practice, Ryan Education Consulting LLC, where I develop curricular material and write assessment items. And I couldn’t love it more! During this time, I also pursued a passion project of becoming a children’s book author. After having my son, I wrote <em>Let’s Learn about Chemistry</em> and it was published in June 2020.</p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em><strong>1. How would you describe your job/role?</strong></em><br>I work with stakeholders to develop curricular materials and assessments. Some days that means I get to read through science journals and news media to find unique contexts- and those are my favorite days! I write materials that help scaffold knowledge in the ways that people learn, and with that assessments that give a picture into their understandings. Another hat I wear is that of a science communicator. I work with others to help people find the science in their everyday and to make it less daunting! During COVID19 social distancing times, I have been very active on my Instagram account, sharing activities that I do with my son.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>2. What are some challenges you have faced in this field?</em></strong><br>When I first started after my PhD I faced an opinion that “I just got out of school” and that I was green, despite my years of experience during my Ph.D. program and postdoc. To people outside academia, they didn’t understand that I was managing large scale projects, and this wasn’t anything new to me. It was almost as though I had to prove myself even more, that yes, I belonged here.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>3. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong><br>I chose the Learning Sciences because I wanted to learn more about how people learned chemistry. I wanted to think of ways that we can teach chemistry better, so that we don’t hear “Oh, I hated chemistry in school” so often. As a society, so many of us fear science or don’t understand it. This can lead to mistrust of scientists or the extreme opposite of blindly following someone who says they are a scientist, without critically thinking about what they are saying. It has always been my goal to make science accessible for everyone and to help us become more informed citizens of the world.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>4. What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong><br>A learning sciences degree opens so many doors that it is difficult to list all of the cool things people do with them! People design new technologies for learning, identify issues in education and design solutions, conduct research to determine mental models that students have when working through a problem, design assessments and curricular materials, etc. The field itself is interdisciplinary—so people work across domains and across sectors to find solutions.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>5. What are 3 things that you wish could change about STEM?</em></strong><br>I would change the narrative of what it means to be a scientist. When I first got into the field, I remember the “Draw a Scientist” activity, where students often drew a white male with a lab coat. It warms my heart to see trends shifting, at least in the classrooms when I’ve done this activity, that they draw themselves, one even drew herself wearing JUICY sweats. Being a scientist is for everyone, and everyone who wants to be a scientist can be. It is not just for white men! There are so many initiatives out there that I think help with this. Another thing I would change is the way we teach science, and granted, I think this shift is currently happening. Rather than teaching science as a book of facts, we need to teach it like a tool to help us find answers to our burning questions. If we teach it this way, then when we find new information that changes a recommendation, such as wearing masks, the general population won’t think that scientists don’t know what they are doing. They will understand that this is real science, a continually shifting body of knowledge that updates with new data. Finally, I would change the “weed-out” course structure. This is such a leak in the STEM pipeline and so many passionate future scientists are lost through this leak.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>6. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></strong><br>Showing girls what real scientists look like will help them stay in STEM. When I was in graduate school, I would hear “Oh you don’t look like a scientist” and I was of a generation where I took that as a compliment. Looking back, I cringe when I think of that. I should have asked, “Why not? What does a scientist look like and do in your mind?” Showing girls that you can be girly and into makeup and still like science or that you can have blue hair and work at NASA is so important. There are some amazing Instagram accounts that focus on this&#8212; showing real women in their real lives as scientists and at home.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>7. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Always consider every opportunity. You never know where it might take you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In high school I took an AP Psychology course that sparked my interest in understanding human cognition. I was particularly interested in what happens during our early years and how that shapes who we become as adults. During my freshmen year of undergrad, I enrolled in a philosophy course on Contemporary Moral Issues that inadvertently began my interest into interdisciplinary studies. As a Psychology major minoring in Neuroscience and Philosophy, I found a unexpected amount of overlap in content that encouraged me to incorporate concepts from unrelated courses in order to answer questions and engage in discussions on cognition. In the semesters that followed, I implemented what I had learned in my Contemporary Moral Issues class as a reminder of the guiding principles and biases that result from an individual’s personal history that can later show through in their research and academic endeavors. I also applied this lesson to my own thinking, so that I could try to minimize my own biases and be as open as possible in my studies.</p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>1. How would you describe your role?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am currently a Cognitive Science PhD Candidate at Brown University. In this role I take courses, conduct research, and work as a teaching assistant for undergrad classes. I am also the Educational Research Lead for the upcoming Katsuiku Academy in Tokyo, Japan. In this role I apply current research to policy and practice. I work with the team to develop a research-based curriculum that hopes to educate and nurture high school students in preparation for the future.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>2. What are some challenges you have faced in this research?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Valuation of this work and its wide-reaching broader impact. People oftentimes dismiss “soft” science fields and do not see the rigor and importance of the contributions we make.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>3. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I chose Cognitive Science because it allowed me to utilize methods and theories from fields outside of my department such as Education and Economics to answer questions about cognition.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>4. What’s the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The best way to enter the field is to familiarize yourself with it’s associated fields. Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind (i.e., cognition). It combines methods and theories from fields such as psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, and computer science etc. Skills that are important for building a successful career include an understanding of research methods, statistical analysis, coding languages, and computational modeling. For those that are interested in conducting research, additional experience in research traditional research methods like surveying and interviews, as well neuroimaging techniques (e.g. fMRI, EEG, fNIRS etc.) are invaluable.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>5. What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The most exciting/flashy thing people in my profession work on is artificial intelligence and machine learning. This includes self-driving cars, virtual reality simulation, and robotic companions for elderly people. Understanding how the brain processes information and executes actions allows us to reproduce these abilities in machines.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>6. What keeps you going in your research? What’s next for your career?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Improving the condition and future for Black and brown children. Although I am not sure of what exactly I will be doing, I hope to continue academic and social programming consulting and research to support children at the margins.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>7. What is it like to be a woman in STEM? What are some challenges that you have faced?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Being a woman in STEM is like being a woman in any part or sector of life. There is predisposition for men and even other women to dismiss or give passing acknowledgement to you as a scientist. This is exacerbated when you hold a BIPOC identity. It is important to ground yourself in why you are taking on these hurdles/challenges. Without this, imposter syndrome and stereotype threat can prevent you from reaching your full potential.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>8. What are 3 things that you wish could change about STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Barriers to access to STEM education and opportunities for BIPOC people that are present as early as childhood.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The myth of meritocracy-based advancement in academia. It is not the case that advancement is solely based on hard work, talent, and good scientific practice.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Blind trust and belief in past scientific research that is rooted in racism and oppression.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>9. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Self-advocacy. Getting the resources and mentorship you need, and ultimately getting to where you want to be career wise is dependent on advocating for yourself. I attended a large public university for my undergraduate degree, and I curated my ideal experience by seeking out help and opportunities. Sometimes that meant not going to the most obvious people (e.g. program counselors) because I didn’t fit the mold of a student that they perceived as successful.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Many times, people tell you to figure out what you want to do, but they don’t mention half the battle. You have to figure out what you’re not interested in to figure out what your passions and purpose is. I have worked in multiple labs and taken course work in various fields. Many of them weren’t for me, but those experiences allowed me to narrow down my interests and strengths.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>10. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Your unique experience and perspective are invaluable. Don’t be afraid to pour your personal self into your professional life. It could be the difference between novel contributions and self-actualization or going along just to get along.</p>



<p></p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>1. How would you describe your role?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Right now, I am a last year PhD student (I plan to defend my thesis in June 2021) at an Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Cracow. However, my favorite way to describe myself is young scientist! I love my job because I get to do a little bit of everything &#8211; I am writing my thesis, managing funding, publishing, leading my own project, working as the vice president of the student council, preparing for scientific stay in the US, and in my free time I love to talk about science!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>2. What are some challenges you have faced in this research?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Anxiety and imposter syndrome are two challenges that I am still working on. I believe the best way to overcome problems is facing them, which is why I always try to push myself to do things outside of my comfort zone.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am currently leading a project concerning nanomaterials. The whole process from writing the proposal, getting the funding to actually doing the research has been an equally amazing and terrifying adventure. Being in charge is extremely gratifying but also requires being prepared for the unexpected.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>3. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My journey into STEM was… a bumpy one. In school I liked math, physics and chemistry… but it wasn’t reciprocated. Even though we had a complicated relationship, my fascination with STEM began in school, when I almost didn’t pass physics class and was made to prepare a presentation about black holes. I started reading a lot of books and I just got hooked on. (We’re made of star stuff?! The Universe is how old?! A teaspoonful of a neutron star would weigh a billion tons?!). The less I understood, the more information I craved. Even though it took me a lot of work and effort, I’ve managed to work on my math and chemistry and decided to go into STEM.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I chose Materials Engineering for my Engineer and Master Degrees as I was looking for something connected with chemistry, but at the same time I wanted that sweet, sweet engineer title. Materials Engineering seemed fun and challenging and that’s how I am were I am today!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>4. What’s the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Materials Science is a fascinating field that combines chemistry, physics and a lot of engineering and if you want to pursue a scientific career and/or a PhD in it, you should start with choosing the right path at the university. Studying Materials Science or Materials Engineering is a great way to start but it’s not the only way! I have friends who are pursuing a PhD in Materials Science, although they have a master’s in physics, chemistry, bioengineering, electronics or metallurgy. This often gives them a unique perspective on the world of Materials Science.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Other than choosing the right studies, the most important thing is to learn to take (calculated) risks (which I’m pretty sure applies to all fields in STEM!). Think big, don’t be afraid – apply for internships and apprenticeships (especially ones that are abroad – there are many ways to fund those!), ask professors if you can help in the lab, look for mentors (there are a lot of mentorships programs in different STEM fields), join societies or science clubs (it’s an awesome way to meet people and work on those soft skills). Get as much of various experiences as you can and stay curious!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>5. What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Everything around us is made from materials – so materials science touches our lives in every possible way. Personally, I work on metals that are liquid at room temperature (just like mercury, however in my case those metals are nontoxic and safe to handle). But people in Materials Science work on all kinds of cool materials and technologies like aerogels (materials literally made from up to 99.8% of nothing), breathable liquids (liquids, that can have so much oxygen dissolved in them that you would actually be able to breathe in them) or shape memory alloys (those are metals that can change shape if for example the temperature changes!).</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>6. What keeps you going in your research? What’s next for your career?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">What keeps me going is the challenge and the opportunity to try new things, go to new places, and meet new people. I put a lot of effort and time into my research because I have fun and I love what I do!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">What’s next? I am not sure yet! I have a few months left in my PhD and although (despite its many problems) I love academia, I would love trying to flirt a bit with industry. At the moment I’ve secured funding for 3 months stay at University College London after my PhD, and I am actively looking for new opportunities!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>7. What is it like to be a woman in STEM? What are some challenges that you have faced?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Materials Science is a STEM fields where there are a lot of women (at least when it comes to students &#8211; it gets worse after getting a PhD). Last year in Poland almost 48% of materials engineering students were female. The data however does not lie – at the grad school level almost the same amount of men and women get funding (for projects, grants and scholarships), however the proportion changes the higher the step in the career is (for example in Poland, for a grant dedicated only for professors, only 8% of the grants were awarded to woman).</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>8. What are 3 things that you wish could change about STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f5e3.png" alt="🗣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Open access to science – the process of publishers getting all the money, while the authors and reviewers don’t see a penny out of it and then the readers have then to pay for it horrendous amounts of money… It’s not okay. Science should be accessible to all.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f5e3.png" alt="🗣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Communicating science to the public – the public doesn’t really understand how science works (the misconceptions about Covid-19, are just another proof of that) and we, as scientist and people in STEM, are not doing enough to change that. We don’t talk about how we do science; we don’t try to explain our results in an understandable way, we just don’t talk to the people who very often are the ones paying for the research through their taxes.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f5e3.png" alt="🗣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Mental health in STEM – there is often a very unhealthy culture in STEM (it will depend on the place, the group and the people but it happens more often than not), forcing people to work long hours, not take breaks and just keep comparing yourself to others. Studies show that the mental health of a lot of PhD students is not the best (in Nature PhD Survey 2019, 36% of students reported that they have sought help for anxiety or depression caused by their PhD studies!) and that is something that should be addressed.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>9. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am not an expert in the field (however there is some scientific research done concerning the topic and I would love to learn more) but what would have personally helped me was to not treat science as a gendered issue. Boys are shown how cars work, for girls it happens much less often. Teachers and parents often assume that boys should be able to repair things or solve computers problems, automatically sending a signal to girls that they don’t need to have that knowledge. We buy boys a lot of cool, science-y toys, and we buy girls dolls, and we expect the kids to form the same interests. Hand on experience with science and technology would have helped me, personally, when I was younger.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>10. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Being a scientist is a viable career option and it allows you to learn new stuff every day, travel the world and push the limits of the Unknown. It’s not going to be easy, but it will be worth it. If you’re curious and willing to work hard, you can do it!</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">I’m a Nigerian-American Software Engineer based in the New York City Area. I also am a co-founder and COO of MacScientits, a publication aimed at uplifting women of color in STEM and founder and CEO of Creatic Ventures, a digital creative studio providing website design and system optimization services for digital service providers and content creators. I graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Pittsburgh and love traveling, running, and doing yoga.</p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>1. What is your specific area of STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am a Software Engineer and I work on building new features for mobile and desktop applications.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>2. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">When I was little, I was always the kid who was curious about how computers worked. Fast-forwarding to when it was time to apply to college I felt that it just made sense to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering. I explored other types of engineering disciplines but realized that I wanted to just apply computer engineering principles to them.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>3. What’s the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There’s so many ways to enter the tech industry. Whether you pursue a traditional or non-traditional route, it is important that you have a good understanding of data structures and algorithms because that is what employers are looking for when you interview. If coding isn’t your strong suit, there are many other jobs such as project management, design, and product management that are also ways of getting into the industry. I would say focus on your interests and let that carry you into your next tech job. </p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>4. What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">People in my field are building a lot of the tools that you use today! If you have a cellphone, use a computer, or anything involving a code/software script, software engineers played a vital part in building them. As a software engineer you have the capability to make an impact on millions of people across the world.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>5. What keeps you going in your profession? What’s next for your career?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">What keeps me going is my quest for knowledge. I still feel like there’s so much that I don’t know and I’m excited to learn more and dive deeper. For my career I want to dive deeper into becoming an industry leader for my technical abilities. </p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>6. What is it like to be a woman in STEM? What are some challenges that you have faced?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">If I am being completely honest, it can be a little isolating and discouraging at times. I struggled a lot with not finding people who could relate to me and to connect with in my classes. When I started working I felt a lot of imposter syndrome and struggled to feel like I belonged or that I was valued. That being said, I found a strong sense of community with my friends outside of the classroom and sought to find a work environment where I felt much appreciated and considered. </p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>7. What are 3 things that you wish could change about STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I wish I could change the lack of diversity within STEM fields  as well as the barriers to enter this field. A lot of jobs in STEM require you to have some sort of formalized education which isn’t always accessible to everyone. Additionally, I would want to change the way there’s so much elitism to be studying STEM. I hated when professors would call a class a “weed out” class. Why are you trying to weed people out? STEM should be inclusive. </p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>8. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Exposure! Seeing more people who look like you pursuing a career in STEM as well as finding fun and creative ways to learn about science provides an excellent avenue to get more girls involved and interested. </p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>9. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">You can do it! It can be hard sometimes, but don’t get discouraged. There’s so much to learn and there’s so many different paths. You can make it work for you.</p>



<p></p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>1. How would you describe your job/role?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">A PhD candidate is somewhere between a student and full-flung researcher. I no longer attend courses, but I am still very much learning. As a graduate student, it is less about memorization and more about problem solving, planning, and applying your knowledge in new ways. I still have a professor who helps in my growth and a committee I update on my progress towards my degree. I have a lot of independence to dive into projects and examine what interests me, with the support of my mentors.<br>A vast majority of my project involves examining thin slices of tissue under a microscope looking for proteins. These proteins glow under florescent light due to a process I put them through, making these beautiful technicolored images. The reason I do this is because I am interested in discovering if certain genes are present in the tissue and are making these proteins. These genes could unlock how the parathyroid and thymus are created!</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>2. What are some challenges you have faced in this research?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My biggest challenge is that the process to make the proteins “glow” (called immunohistochemistry) is easy to mess up. It requires following an exact protocol, otherwise precious samples could be lost forever. There is nothing more frustrating than going through two days of work, looking under the microscope, and seeing nothing! Also, being a PhD candidate can be hard because there are high expectations of your productivity. It can be easy to lose yourself in your work and forget to take a break! Work-life balance is very important in STEM.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>3. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I have always wanted to go into a STEM field, although I didn’t know that I wanted to go into genetics until high school. My mother got her degree in geology, and while she got pushed out of the field due to sexism (my mother was made to do paperwork while her male colleagues got to do field work), she wanted me to know that I could be whatever I wanted and to disregard anyone who said otherwise. Her voice drove me to pursue higher education and be the first person in my family to attend graduate school.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>4. What’s the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I don’t think there is any right way to pursue genetics. A lot of the advice I hear is to join a lab <em>as an undergraduate</em>. But personally, I went to a small liberal arts school and while I got exposure to lab work, this was very different than larger campuses where you can join a traditional “lab”. I also took a gap year between undergraduate and graduate to work in science policy!<br>The closest I came to getting “lab experience” was a few months as a post-baccalaureate researcher in what would eventually become by thesis lab. I think if you’re passionate about being a STEM researcher you can do a lot to gain experience! You can take a gap year and work in biotech, you can be a technician in a lab, you can do research as an undergrad, or even in high school! Whatever works for you and your life experience.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>5. What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are <em>so </em>many things you can do with a degree in genetics! You can work in biotechnology (think companies like 23andMe), biomedicine (Interested in curing cancer? Think about the growing field of immunotherapy!), academia (professors not only get to teach the next generation of scientists, they can continue to make extraordinary jumps in science), science communication or journalism (what better person to explain what CRISPR is than someone who has used it?), or science policy, which is what I plan on going into.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>6. What keeps you going in your research? What’s next for your career?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am a big believer that science should benefit all of society. My current research lands firmly in the biomedical field, which means some day my research might help a future scientist develop a cure to a disease or create a new treatment. Science is constantly building upon itself, so if I could provide even just one leg up to the next scientist with my data, I know I’ve done good.<br>Next up for my career to take my love of science and beliefs about science helping society to the next level- science policy! I am passionate about biosecurity, which means protecting the public from anything that could harm them of biological origin, from pandemics to anthrax. Scientists are always needed in fields like this because we provide expertise and understanding.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>7. What is it like to be a woman in STEM? What are some challenges that you have faced?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Being a woman in STEM can be hard, I won’t deny it. I’ve been sexually harassed by professors and disparaged by male colleagues. I have been told more times than I can count that I am “too pretty to do science” which is, abjectly, the most horrendously stupid thing I have ever heard. Your appearance has nothing to do with your ability to do science. Race, gender, or ability have zero impact on your ability to do science. Luckily, for every comment like that I have met an incredible person who is succeeding and thriving in STEM and is there to support me. And with online and in person communities fostering and supporting diversity in STEM, it is easier now than it has been in the past (for people like my mother) to find a home in STEM. I have so many queer and women role models in STEM that I look up to now!</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>8. What are 3 things that you wish could change about STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">1) The gender and racial disparity in STEM. There are not nearly enough people of color or women in these fields.<br>2) The pressure on graduate students. Graduate students in STEM have some of the highest levels of depression and anxiety, typically due to the sometimes very toxic environments in academia.<br>3) The “Ivory Tower” mentality. Science should be easily accessible and understandable. Scientists can often get lost in their niche that they only ever communicate with other scientists. Most of our research is funded by the public, so our research should be too, not hidden behind paywalls!</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>9. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Exposure. You cannot know if you are interested in something if you’ve never witnessed it! For example, my mother often bought me toys that were from the “boys” section because that’s where things like science kits, dinosaur toys, and other STEM-related toys were located. I am so glad that in recent years this has changed some, but a lot of work still needs to be done. A Barbie in a lab coat is great, but let’s push our girls to keep asking questions and to not be discouraged in school (especially high school). Let’s show them famous women scientists and what they discovered, and let’s get them in the lab, behind the computer, or in the field out having <em>fun</em>.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>10. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Never, ever let anyone tell you that you aren’t good enough to be what you want to be. That includes adults! If something makes you excited or curious, chase that feeling. If you change your mind, that is totally fine, but let it be because <em>you</em> want to do something else, not because the world said you should. It’s hard, I know, but sometimes being stubborn isn’t a bad thing.<br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Greetings fellow Earthlings! My name is Tanya, I’m a chemical and biomolecular engineer that develops environmental technology for terrestrial and space applications. Clean water is vital no matter where you are in the universe, I dream about a world where we don’t have to worry about drinking harmful contaminants. I’d like to share my story for all the women out there facing similar obstacles in life. Some parts will come across as sad but don’t worry, things get better as you keep reading.<br /><br />My childhood was pretty rough, grew up in a low-income single parent household with 5 siblings. I saw and experienced more things during my first 10 years of life than anyone should ever have to go through. Luckily, very very luckily, my grandparents helped me escape that situation in my early teens and adopted me. We moved across the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It took a while for me to shake the trauma and bad behaviors I picked up from childhood. Ended up dropping out of high school (do not recommend, stay in school) and it took a while to build myself back up. I got a GED, picked up a job as a waitress, and started taking classes at the local community college (it&#8217;s all I could afford at the time).&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">After getting an associate&#8217;s degree, I transferred to a 4 year university. Halfway through the program I got sick. Really sick. Unfortunately, I was too stubborn at the time to take a break from school (I was literally doing homework in the hospital) and ended up falling behind and failing out of college. I was devastated. My grandparents, the greatest people on this planet, encouraged me to keep trying and find a new door to open.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I wrote a letter to the dean at a college ~2 hours away, explaining my situation and practically begging for a second chance. To my surprise at the time, they accepted me! I&#8217;ll forever be thankful for Prairie View A&amp;M university. My health got better, I maintained a high GPA, and met a space job recruiter by chance while studying in the library.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">After talking to the recruiter for 10 minutes, I knew space science was the right career for me. She was extraordinary, I was inspired by her poise and passion. After an official interview, I received an offer to be an intern that summer.</p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#1829aa;">1<em>. How would you describe your job/role?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In space and on Earth, we take wastewater and use technology to turn it into potable water. That means removing contaminants and harmful microbes from various water sources in order to make safe drinking water. Astronauts like to joke that “yesterday’s coffee is today’s coffee.” When you’re beyond low earth orbit without an abundant supply of water, you have to tap into every potential source such as urine. It’s actually quite complicated to turn urine into drinking water, it’s full of things you don’t want to consume like urea, volatile compounds, inorganic molecules, and bacteria. The further we travel into space, the more water sources we’ll need to sustain life, such as greywater (shower and laundry) and planetary water, each full of things you don’t want to drink. My role is to dream of and develop technologies to clean these water sources.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In parallel, my PhD research focuses on facilitating access to clean water almost anywhere in the world by developing efficient modular water treatment systems that&nbsp;are easy to deploy, that can tap unconventional sources to provide humanitarian water, and develops systems to treat and reuse challenging industrial wastewaters in remote locations. Specifically, I use nanotechnology to remove harmful contaminants such as nitrate in agricultural runoff water and transform them into innocuous compounds that are safe for consumption.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#1829aa;">2. <em>What are some challenges you have faced in this research?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I’ve grown a deep appreciation for gravity. When you take that away, things get weird (and fun). Liquids move differently, gas molecules behave differently, and processes that work on Earth don’t work the same in space. Designing technology around these obstacles is challenging, we’re almost always met with a surprise or two once our hardware makes it to space.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#1829aa;">3. <em>What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Chemical engineering is all about taking one molecule and transforming it into another molecule. Taking one form or energy and converting it into a different form. It’s driven by the fundamental and empirical laws of the universe; I find that deeply comforting and beautiful. In the words of Neil Armstrong, “I&nbsp;am, and ever will be, a white-socks,&nbsp;pocket-protector,&nbsp;nerdy engineer,&nbsp;born under the second law of thermodynamics,&nbsp;steeped in steam&nbsp;tables, in love with free-body diagrams, transformed by Laplace and propelled by compressible flow.”</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#1829aa;">4. <em>What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are so many cool things, it’s hard to choose which one to talk about! In my PhD program, I’m part of an engineering research center full of extraordinary people working on groundbreaking research for water treatment. Using light and nanophotonic to manipulate water, electric fields to influence molecular behavior, magnetic particles to hook-and-bait harmful contaminants, it’s all so fascinating.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">When it comes to space, I’m always fascinated by the work done by Dr. Mark Weislogel and that team. Mark specializes in capillary fluids, he’s a wizard when it comes to water in microgravity. Using engineering shapes and geometry, they can bend and control the behavior of water to move without using a pump or external forces. Pretty cool. Really really cool.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#1829aa;">5. <em>What is it like to be a woman in STEM? What are some challenges that you have faced</em>?</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I’m proud to be a woman in STEM and very grateful for all the women in the world that have fought and are continuing to fight for equality in the workplace. I carry their strength, resilience, determination, and sisterhood with me. I’m very fortunate, at both my space job and my PhD program, women are respected, treated with respect, and our achievements are celebrated and recognized.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, this has not always been the case. At a previous job, no matter how hard I tried, folks disregarded my abilities and didn’t take me seriously. I was flaunted around for being “the girl” and invited to big meetings and dinners with important clients just because of my gender. I hate that this is a story that every woman in STEM has and I look forward to a day when that is no longer true.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#1829aa;">6<em>. What are 3 things that you wish could change about STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f469-1f3fb-200d-1f680.png" alt="👩🏻‍🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />The number of women in STEM. Women constitute less than 30% of the STEM industry. STEM jobs are building the world and future, solving our world’s greatest challenges. I want to see more women at the forefront of these endeavors.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f469-1f3fb-200d-1f680.png" alt="👩🏻‍🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />The accessibility to STEM for girls growing up in low-income communities. We need to address social oppression, we need to give students in the 5<sup>th</sup> ward access to the same resources as students in ivy league schools, we need to help these students learn that they are not bound by their situation.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f469-1f3fb-200d-1f680.png" alt="👩🏻‍🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />The lack of recognition given to women in STEM. I cried happy tears a few days ago when it was announced that 3 women in STEM are receiving the Nobel Prize this year. At the same time, I felt sad – of the 605 people awarded Nobel prizes in scientific disciplines (chemistry, physics, physiology or medicine) from 1901 to 2017, only 18 were women. That’s less than 3%.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#1829aa;">7. <em>What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">When I was growing up, we were taught that women can be one or the other, the “smart girl” or “the girly girl.” You don’t have to choose and you can be both if you want to. If you want to be a cheerleader that thinks bugs are cool and listens to both heavy metal and pop music, do it. Wear makeup or don’t wear makeup, wear dresses or wear sweatpants or wear both, wear heels or old sneakers or both…do whatever you enjoy and makes you happy. Science doesn’t care about any of that, all you need is a curious mind.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hello, my name is Laura and I am a Marine Biology student at University of Portsmouth. I completed my foundation degree (FdSc) in Marine Ecology and Conservation at University Centre Sparsholt in Winchester this past June. I have recently moved down to Portsmouth to do a top up year which will give me a full honors BSc degree in Marine Biology. I have always loved being by the coast, whether it be rock pooling, bodyboarding, going on boat trips or simply swimming. I soon realized that studying the ocean would be my dream, however I never thought I would have the grades or intelligence to do it. However, by doing a foundation degree I was able to find a way into my dream field where I originally thought I would never have the chance.</p>

<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>1. How would you describe your role?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Currently I am a University student, so I am still studying for my bachelor’s degree. As I am in my final year, I am working on my final year project which involves doing independent research on a chosen subject and writing a scientific paper about the subject discussing what you have found. The research that I will be looking at focuses on dolphin identification and analyzing dolphins dorsal fin scars to explore not only the origins of the scars but if there are patterns in which they occur. The sorts of patterns I will be looking into may include “Do dolphins get more scars at certain times of the year?”, “Do male dolphins have more scars than female dolphins?” and “Are younger dolphins more likely to get scars than older dolphins?”. Although I am yet to start my research, I have a good understanding of these focuses and can’t wait to see what I find out.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>2. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I actually didn’t know what STEM was until I started university. Since discovering what STEM was, I realized that women are very underrepresented and there are far too many people out there that think that women can’t/are unable to have a job in STEM discipline.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I do have some massive inspirations that helped me realize that Marine Biology was something that I wanted to pursue. Dr. Sylvia Earle is my biggest inspiration and a woman I would love to meet. Sylvia is a Marine Biologist and oceanographer who is now 85 and has spent her life researching the oceans and raising awareness for the need of conservation. She has a charity called Mission Blue (which is also the name of her Netflix documentary which I thoroughly recommend everyone to watch) which helps to create ‘Hope spots’ of marine protected areas. She has also done many talks around the world, including one for TED which is about 10 minutes long and a must watch.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>3. What’s the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In terms of school to be able to study marine biology at university you want to make sure you have focused your studies at school to some of the sciences. Biology, Geography and Maths are pretty useful to have; however, they are not always necessary depending on where you want to study but will give you a good head start.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Its always good to try and get volunteer work either before or whilst you’re studying for your degree. If you live near the coast you may be able to organize local beach clean ups, this will show that you are driven and organized. There may also be local rescue centers for animals such as seals who may take volunteers. Otherwise any sort of aquarium, pet shop, conservation or wildlife organization will be beneficial.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>4. What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are so many amazing things going on in Marine Biology at the moment. There are companies that are growing and replanting corals to help restore coral reefs that have been affected by climate change. There are companies who are tagging marine animals such as sharks and turtles in order to be able to track and research their patterns in terms of migration, feeding and reproduction. Restoring seagrass beds, dealing with oil spills, research in laboratories in microbiology, diving research and much more.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>5. What keeps you going in your research? What’s next for your career?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am hoping to go on to do a masters in either Marine Biology, Marine Ecology and Conservation or Marine Mammal science once I have completed my BSc. After this I hope to be able to travel the world and do research and raise awareness for conservation of the oceans.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>6. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I honestly think social networking can be a real help. Since starting my marine biology Instagram account, I have met so many amazing women in STEM and in my field specifically. It can be so useful to know other people in the field. Everyone has their own areas and each friend you make will be able to give you tips and tricks on certain things whether it be diving centers/sites in a certain country, sustainability and eco friendly tips, best universities for masters degrees, best places to find volunteer work and books/journals/papers to read. Once you have a community of other women in STEM you feel unstoppable and supported and motivated to keep pushing and inspiring more women to join STEM disciplines.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>7. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Don’t let other people put down your dreams. If you want something enough and you work hard enough you will be able to do anything. It is your life and you are the one that has to live it so you can’t let people tell you what you can and can’t do.</p>

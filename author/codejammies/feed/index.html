<p class="has-medium-font-size">I’m a Nigerian-American Software Engineer based in the New York City Area. I also am a co-founder and COO of MacScientits, a publication aimed at uplifting women of color in STEM and founder and CEO of Creatic Ventures, a digital creative studio providing website design and system optimization services for digital service providers and content creators. I graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Pittsburgh and love traveling, running, and doing yoga.</p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>1. What is your specific area of STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am a Software Engineer and I work on building new features for mobile and desktop applications.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>2. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">When I was little, I was always the kid who was curious about how computers worked. Fast-forwarding to when it was time to apply to college I felt that it just made sense to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering. I explored other types of engineering disciplines but realized that I wanted to just apply computer engineering principles to them.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>3. What’s the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There’s so many ways to enter the tech industry. Whether you pursue a traditional or non-traditional route, it is important that you have a good understanding of data structures and algorithms because that is what employers are looking for when you interview. If coding isn’t your strong suit, there are many other jobs such as project management, design, and product management that are also ways of getting into the industry. I would say focus on your interests and let that carry you into your next tech job. </p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>4. What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">People in my field are building a lot of the tools that you use today! If you have a cellphone, use a computer, or anything involving a code/software script, software engineers played a vital part in building them. As a software engineer you have the capability to make an impact on millions of people across the world.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>5. What keeps you going in your profession? What’s next for your career?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">What keeps me going is my quest for knowledge. I still feel like there’s so much that I don’t know and I’m excited to learn more and dive deeper. For my career I want to dive deeper into becoming an industry leader for my technical abilities. </p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>6. What is it like to be a woman in STEM? What are some challenges that you have faced?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">If I am being completely honest, it can be a little isolating and discouraging at times. I struggled a lot with not finding people who could relate to me and to connect with in my classes. When I started working I felt a lot of imposter syndrome and struggled to feel like I belonged or that I was valued. That being said, I found a strong sense of community with my friends outside of the classroom and sought to find a work environment where I felt much appreciated and considered. </p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>7. What are 3 things that you wish could change about STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I wish I could change the lack of diversity within STEM fields  as well as the barriers to enter this field. A lot of jobs in STEM require you to have some sort of formalized education which isn’t always accessible to everyone. Additionally, I would want to change the way there’s so much elitism to be studying STEM. I hated when professors would call a class a “weed out” class. Why are you trying to weed people out? STEM should be inclusive. </p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>8. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Exposure! Seeing more people who look like you pursuing a career in STEM as well as finding fun and creative ways to learn about science provides an excellent avenue to get more girls involved and interested. </p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>9. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">You can do it! It can be hard sometimes, but don’t get discouraged. There’s so much to learn and there’s so many different paths. You can make it work for you.</p>



<p></p>

<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>1. How would you describe your job/role?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">A PhD candidate is somewhere between a student and full-flung researcher. I no longer attend courses, but I am still very much learning. As a graduate student, it is less about memorization and more about problem solving, planning, and applying your knowledge in new ways. I still have a professor who helps in my growth and a committee I update on my progress towards my degree. I have a lot of independence to dive into projects and examine what interests me, with the support of my mentors.<br>A vast majority of my project involves examining thin slices of tissue under a microscope looking for proteins. These proteins glow under florescent light due to a process I put them through, making these beautiful technicolored images. The reason I do this is because I am interested in discovering if certain genes are present in the tissue and are making these proteins. These genes could unlock how the parathyroid and thymus are created!</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>2. What are some challenges you have faced in this research?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My biggest challenge is that the process to make the proteins “glow” (called immunohistochemistry) is easy to mess up. It requires following an exact protocol, otherwise precious samples could be lost forever. There is nothing more frustrating than going through two days of work, looking under the microscope, and seeing nothing! Also, being a PhD candidate can be hard because there are high expectations of your productivity. It can be easy to lose yourself in your work and forget to take a break! Work-life balance is very important in STEM.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>3. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I have always wanted to go into a STEM field, although I didn’t know that I wanted to go into genetics until high school. My mother got her degree in geology, and while she got pushed out of the field due to sexism (my mother was made to do paperwork while her male colleagues got to do field work), she wanted me to know that I could be whatever I wanted and to disregard anyone who said otherwise. Her voice drove me to pursue higher education and be the first person in my family to attend graduate school.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>4. What’s the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I don’t think there is any right way to pursue genetics. A lot of the advice I hear is to join a lab <em>as an undergraduate</em>. But personally, I went to a small liberal arts school and while I got exposure to lab work, this was very different than larger campuses where you can join a traditional “lab”. I also took a gap year between undergraduate and graduate to work in science policy!<br>The closest I came to getting “lab experience” was a few months as a post-baccalaureate researcher in what would eventually become by thesis lab. I think if you’re passionate about being a STEM researcher you can do a lot to gain experience! You can take a gap year and work in biotech, you can be a technician in a lab, you can do research as an undergrad, or even in high school! Whatever works for you and your life experience.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>5. What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are <em>so </em>many things you can do with a degree in genetics! You can work in biotechnology (think companies like 23andMe), biomedicine (Interested in curing cancer? Think about the growing field of immunotherapy!), academia (professors not only get to teach the next generation of scientists, they can continue to make extraordinary jumps in science), science communication or journalism (what better person to explain what CRISPR is than someone who has used it?), or science policy, which is what I plan on going into.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>6. What keeps you going in your research? What’s next for your career?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am a big believer that science should benefit all of society. My current research lands firmly in the biomedical field, which means some day my research might help a future scientist develop a cure to a disease or create a new treatment. Science is constantly building upon itself, so if I could provide even just one leg up to the next scientist with my data, I know I’ve done good.<br>Next up for my career to take my love of science and beliefs about science helping society to the next level- science policy! I am passionate about biosecurity, which means protecting the public from anything that could harm them of biological origin, from pandemics to anthrax. Scientists are always needed in fields like this because we provide expertise and understanding.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>7. What is it like to be a woman in STEM? What are some challenges that you have faced?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Being a woman in STEM can be hard, I won’t deny it. I’ve been sexually harassed by professors and disparaged by male colleagues. I have been told more times than I can count that I am “too pretty to do science” which is, abjectly, the most horrendously stupid thing I have ever heard. Your appearance has nothing to do with your ability to do science. Race, gender, or ability have zero impact on your ability to do science. Luckily, for every comment like that I have met an incredible person who is succeeding and thriving in STEM and is there to support me. And with online and in person communities fostering and supporting diversity in STEM, it is easier now than it has been in the past (for people like my mother) to find a home in STEM. I have so many queer and women role models in STEM that I look up to now!</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>8. What are 3 things that you wish could change about STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">1) The gender and racial disparity in STEM. There are not nearly enough people of color or women in these fields.<br>2) The pressure on graduate students. Graduate students in STEM have some of the highest levels of depression and anxiety, typically due to the sometimes very toxic environments in academia.<br>3) The “Ivory Tower” mentality. Science should be easily accessible and understandable. Scientists can often get lost in their niche that they only ever communicate with other scientists. Most of our research is funded by the public, so our research should be too, not hidden behind paywalls!</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>9. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Exposure. You cannot know if you are interested in something if you’ve never witnessed it! For example, my mother often bought me toys that were from the “boys” section because that’s where things like science kits, dinosaur toys, and other STEM-related toys were located. I am so glad that in recent years this has changed some, but a lot of work still needs to be done. A Barbie in a lab coat is great, but let’s push our girls to keep asking questions and to not be discouraged in school (especially high school). Let’s show them famous women scientists and what they discovered, and let’s get them in the lab, behind the computer, or in the field out having <em>fun</em>.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>10. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Never, ever let anyone tell you that you aren’t good enough to be what you want to be. That includes adults! If something makes you excited or curious, chase that feeling. If you change your mind, that is totally fine, but let it be because <em>you</em> want to do something else, not because the world said you should. It’s hard, I know, but sometimes being stubborn isn’t a bad thing.<br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Greetings fellow Earthlings! My name is Tanya, I’m a chemical and biomolecular engineer that develops environmental technology for terrestrial and space applications. Clean water is vital no matter where you are in the universe, I dream about a world where we don’t have to worry about drinking harmful contaminants. I’d like to share my story for all the women out there facing similar obstacles in life. Some parts will come across as sad but don’t worry, things get better as you keep reading.<br /><br />My childhood was pretty rough, grew up in a low-income single parent household with 5 siblings. I saw and experienced more things during my first 10 years of life than anyone should ever have to go through. Luckily, very very luckily, my grandparents helped me escape that situation in my early teens and adopted me. We moved across the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It took a while for me to shake the trauma and bad behaviors I picked up from childhood. Ended up dropping out of high school (do not recommend, stay in school) and it took a while to build myself back up. I got a GED, picked up a job as a waitress, and started taking classes at the local community college (it&#8217;s all I could afford at the time).&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">After getting an associate&#8217;s degree, I transferred to a 4 year university. Halfway through the program I got sick. Really sick. Unfortunately, I was too stubborn at the time to take a break from school (I was literally doing homework in the hospital) and ended up falling behind and failing out of college. I was devastated. My grandparents, the greatest people on this planet, encouraged me to keep trying and find a new door to open.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I wrote a letter to the dean at a college ~2 hours away, explaining my situation and practically begging for a second chance. To my surprise at the time, they accepted me! I&#8217;ll forever be thankful for Prairie View A&amp;M university. My health got better, I maintained a high GPA, and met a space job recruiter by chance while studying in the library.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">After talking to the recruiter for 10 minutes, I knew space science was the right career for me. She was extraordinary, I was inspired by her poise and passion. After an official interview, I received an offer to be an intern that summer.</p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#1829aa;">1<em>. How would you describe your job/role?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In space and on Earth, we take wastewater and use technology to turn it into potable water. That means removing contaminants and harmful microbes from various water sources in order to make safe drinking water. Astronauts like to joke that “yesterday’s coffee is today’s coffee.” When you’re beyond low earth orbit without an abundant supply of water, you have to tap into every potential source such as urine. It’s actually quite complicated to turn urine into drinking water, it’s full of things you don’t want to consume like urea, volatile compounds, inorganic molecules, and bacteria. The further we travel into space, the more water sources we’ll need to sustain life, such as greywater (shower and laundry) and planetary water, each full of things you don’t want to drink. My role is to dream of and develop technologies to clean these water sources.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In parallel, my PhD research focuses on facilitating access to clean water almost anywhere in the world by developing efficient modular water treatment systems that&nbsp;are easy to deploy, that can tap unconventional sources to provide humanitarian water, and develops systems to treat and reuse challenging industrial wastewaters in remote locations. Specifically, I use nanotechnology to remove harmful contaminants such as nitrate in agricultural runoff water and transform them into innocuous compounds that are safe for consumption.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#1829aa;">2. <em>What are some challenges you have faced in this research?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I’ve grown a deep appreciation for gravity. When you take that away, things get weird (and fun). Liquids move differently, gas molecules behave differently, and processes that work on Earth don’t work the same in space. Designing technology around these obstacles is challenging, we’re almost always met with a surprise or two once our hardware makes it to space.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#1829aa;">3. <em>What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Chemical engineering is all about taking one molecule and transforming it into another molecule. Taking one form or energy and converting it into a different form. It’s driven by the fundamental and empirical laws of the universe; I find that deeply comforting and beautiful. In the words of Neil Armstrong, “I&nbsp;am, and ever will be, a white-socks,&nbsp;pocket-protector,&nbsp;nerdy engineer,&nbsp;born under the second law of thermodynamics,&nbsp;steeped in steam&nbsp;tables, in love with free-body diagrams, transformed by Laplace and propelled by compressible flow.”</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#1829aa;">4. <em>What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are so many cool things, it’s hard to choose which one to talk about! In my PhD program, I’m part of an engineering research center full of extraordinary people working on groundbreaking research for water treatment. Using light and nanophotonic to manipulate water, electric fields to influence molecular behavior, magnetic particles to hook-and-bait harmful contaminants, it’s all so fascinating.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">When it comes to space, I’m always fascinated by the work done by Dr. Mark Weislogel and that team. Mark specializes in capillary fluids, he’s a wizard when it comes to water in microgravity. Using engineering shapes and geometry, they can bend and control the behavior of water to move without using a pump or external forces. Pretty cool. Really really cool.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#1829aa;">5. <em>What is it like to be a woman in STEM? What are some challenges that you have faced</em>?</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I’m proud to be a woman in STEM and very grateful for all the women in the world that have fought and are continuing to fight for equality in the workplace. I carry their strength, resilience, determination, and sisterhood with me. I’m very fortunate, at both my space job and my PhD program, women are respected, treated with respect, and our achievements are celebrated and recognized.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, this has not always been the case. At a previous job, no matter how hard I tried, folks disregarded my abilities and didn’t take me seriously. I was flaunted around for being “the girl” and invited to big meetings and dinners with important clients just because of my gender. I hate that this is a story that every woman in STEM has and I look forward to a day when that is no longer true.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#1829aa;">6<em>. What are 3 things that you wish could change about STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f469-1f3fb-200d-1f680.png" alt="👩🏻‍🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />The number of women in STEM. Women constitute less than 30% of the STEM industry. STEM jobs are building the world and future, solving our world’s greatest challenges. I want to see more women at the forefront of these endeavors.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f469-1f3fb-200d-1f680.png" alt="👩🏻‍🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />The accessibility to STEM for girls growing up in low-income communities. We need to address social oppression, we need to give students in the 5<sup>th</sup> ward access to the same resources as students in ivy league schools, we need to help these students learn that they are not bound by their situation.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f469-1f3fb-200d-1f680.png" alt="👩🏻‍🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />The lack of recognition given to women in STEM. I cried happy tears a few days ago when it was announced that 3 women in STEM are receiving the Nobel Prize this year. At the same time, I felt sad – of the 605 people awarded Nobel prizes in scientific disciplines (chemistry, physics, physiology or medicine) from 1901 to 2017, only 18 were women. That’s less than 3%.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#1829aa;">7. <em>What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">When I was growing up, we were taught that women can be one or the other, the “smart girl” or “the girly girl.” You don’t have to choose and you can be both if you want to. If you want to be a cheerleader that thinks bugs are cool and listens to both heavy metal and pop music, do it. Wear makeup or don’t wear makeup, wear dresses or wear sweatpants or wear both, wear heels or old sneakers or both…do whatever you enjoy and makes you happy. Science doesn’t care about any of that, all you need is a curious mind.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hello, my name is Laura and I am a Marine Biology student at University of Portsmouth. I completed my foundation degree (FdSc) in Marine Ecology and Conservation at University Centre Sparsholt in Winchester this past June. I have recently moved down to Portsmouth to do a top up year which will give me a full honors BSc degree in Marine Biology. I have always loved being by the coast, whether it be rock pooling, bodyboarding, going on boat trips or simply swimming. I soon realized that studying the ocean would be my dream, however I never thought I would have the grades or intelligence to do it. However, by doing a foundation degree I was able to find a way into my dream field where I originally thought I would never have the chance.</p>

<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>1. How would you describe your role?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Currently I am a University student, so I am still studying for my bachelor’s degree. As I am in my final year, I am working on my final year project which involves doing independent research on a chosen subject and writing a scientific paper about the subject discussing what you have found. The research that I will be looking at focuses on dolphin identification and analyzing dolphins dorsal fin scars to explore not only the origins of the scars but if there are patterns in which they occur. The sorts of patterns I will be looking into may include “Do dolphins get more scars at certain times of the year?”, “Do male dolphins have more scars than female dolphins?” and “Are younger dolphins more likely to get scars than older dolphins?”. Although I am yet to start my research, I have a good understanding of these focuses and can’t wait to see what I find out.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>2. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I actually didn’t know what STEM was until I started university. Since discovering what STEM was, I realized that women are very underrepresented and there are far too many people out there that think that women can’t/are unable to have a job in STEM discipline.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I do have some massive inspirations that helped me realize that Marine Biology was something that I wanted to pursue. Dr. Sylvia Earle is my biggest inspiration and a woman I would love to meet. Sylvia is a Marine Biologist and oceanographer who is now 85 and has spent her life researching the oceans and raising awareness for the need of conservation. She has a charity called Mission Blue (which is also the name of her Netflix documentary which I thoroughly recommend everyone to watch) which helps to create ‘Hope spots’ of marine protected areas. She has also done many talks around the world, including one for TED which is about 10 minutes long and a must watch.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>3. What’s the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In terms of school to be able to study marine biology at university you want to make sure you have focused your studies at school to some of the sciences. Biology, Geography and Maths are pretty useful to have; however, they are not always necessary depending on where you want to study but will give you a good head start.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Its always good to try and get volunteer work either before or whilst you’re studying for your degree. If you live near the coast you may be able to organize local beach clean ups, this will show that you are driven and organized. There may also be local rescue centers for animals such as seals who may take volunteers. Otherwise any sort of aquarium, pet shop, conservation or wildlife organization will be beneficial.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>4. What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are so many amazing things going on in Marine Biology at the moment. There are companies that are growing and replanting corals to help restore coral reefs that have been affected by climate change. There are companies who are tagging marine animals such as sharks and turtles in order to be able to track and research their patterns in terms of migration, feeding and reproduction. Restoring seagrass beds, dealing with oil spills, research in laboratories in microbiology, diving research and much more.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>5. What keeps you going in your research? What’s next for your career?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am hoping to go on to do a masters in either Marine Biology, Marine Ecology and Conservation or Marine Mammal science once I have completed my BSc. After this I hope to be able to travel the world and do research and raise awareness for conservation of the oceans.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>6. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I honestly think social networking can be a real help. Since starting my marine biology Instagram account, I have met so many amazing women in STEM and in my field specifically. It can be so useful to know other people in the field. Everyone has their own areas and each friend you make will be able to give you tips and tricks on certain things whether it be diving centers/sites in a certain country, sustainability and eco friendly tips, best universities for masters degrees, best places to find volunteer work and books/journals/papers to read. Once you have a community of other women in STEM you feel unstoppable and supported and motivated to keep pushing and inspiring more women to join STEM disciplines.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>7. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Don’t let other people put down your dreams. If you want something enough and you work hard enough you will be able to do anything. It is your life and you are the one that has to live it so you can’t let people tell you what you can and can’t do.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hi, I am Ami and I am a Biomedical and Instrumentation engineer. I am originally from India but have been living in the US with my husband and a toddler for quite some time. Back in India, I have worked as a service engineer and a bio-medical (a.k.a clinical) engineer for different companies and hospitals. Apart from that I enjoy cooking, traveling and occasional hiking. I have a degree in HR management and used to tutor kids in Math. Now after a long professional gap, I have decided to pursue Masters.</p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>1. What is your specific area of STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Engineering- I am a biomedical and instrumentation engineer.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>2. How would you explain your STEM field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a person who has years of experience in this field, I can boldly say that it is one of the most interesting and exciting fields one can study, research and work in. Biomedical and instrumentation engineers design medical equipments and devices like artificial organs, body parts and machines for diagnosing health related complexities.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>3. What are some challenges you face in this field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a biomedical engineer the biggest challenge that I&#8217;ve faced is dealing with the customers. In my experience, providing technical support involves on-site visits, working cross-functionally across teams, managing and staying up-to-date with inventories and nudging customers in the right direction to get a product or part that will suit their needs. But what I love the most about my role is that I get to work with customers and help them with a cost-effective equipment planning solution.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>4. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Physics and Math have always interested me. I love the challenges that science and technology throws at us. One day I just thought to myself, how incredible would it be to do something that could change or save lives? Biomedical and instrumentation engineering gave me the chance to do something meaningful with my life. I would say the field itself has proven to be an inspiration to me.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>5. What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Engineers in my profession put great effort in designing and successfully building artificial organs like kidneys, hearts, legs, joints, blood vessels and so on. We also build devices like pacemaker and hearing aids and provide support with it&#8217;s installation, maintenance and educate customers on it&#8217;s usage.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>6. You mentioned continuing your education after a long gap. How does it feel to get back in STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Honestly, I am really excited. It&#8217;s definitely going to be a bit of a challenge since I have a one year old to take care of but nevertheless, I feel empowered. I worked hard to get admission in graduate school- I even joined community college and started working on a field-related course. I manage home and take care of my kid and once my husband gets back from work, I take some time for myself and focus on the course. Over the past months I gained new skills and brushed some old ones. I feel inspired.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>7. What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am completely aware of the gender parity issue in STEM. Things are getting better but I firmly believe that we need more role models to rectify the fact and correct me if I am wrong, we as women have to work harder than men for gaining trust and respect of people in our field.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>8. What message would you like to give to our STEM moms?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As moms we face enough challenges every day, add education and it becomes a whole new level of juggling. It is important to stay positive and focus on the goods rather than the challenges because one day or the other your degree is going to open a whole new window of opportunities. One thing to remember and I don&#8217;t mean to sound cheeky- we are women. We have the ultimate gift of multi-tasking. So to all my ladies, brace up and conquer the world. All you need is a will and a dash of courage. Age is no bar and your kids are your strength, don&#8217;t stop pursuing your goals by making them your weakness.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Have you ever been micromanaged by someone? Turns out more than half of the working population experiences micromanagement. So there is a possibility that you have experienced it too. Certainly, this is something neither the employees nor the employer is proud of. Often micromanagement kills productivity since no one likes someone breathing down their neck all the time. Micromanagement often brings the efficiency down and creates an unhealthy work environment for the employees. But what causes micromanagement? Doubts about employee’s competency, urge to be in control all the time, overly detail-oriented and much more which we will discuss shortly.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-yellow-background-color has-background has-large-font-size">SIGNS YOU ARE BEING MICROMANAGED</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />You are being asked to provide frequent updates.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Even the simplest decision is questioned by the manager.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />You feel being controlled most of the times.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />You are losing confidence.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />You are always worrying about how the manager will react.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-yellow-background-color has-background has-large-font-size">IF YOU ARE BEING MICROMANAGED, DO THIS:</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Gain the micromanager’s trust- Prove that you are capable of handling things on your own.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Document everything you do- I learned this from my mentor and it has personally helped me.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Meet deadlines.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Keep the micromanager in loop in case of any changes. It is important to anticipate a situation and provide updates upfront at least in the beginning to help them with the whole trust process.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Ask for feedback from the manager about your performance.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Communicate how you feel- Usually micromanagers are not aware that they are micromanaging. People try to improve efficiency but end up becoming controlling. There is a thin line between being detail-oriented and obsessive, and unfortunately employees are the ones realizing it first. Let the manager know how this is in fact affecting your efficiency and mental health in your next 1:1.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-yellow-background-color has-background has-large-font-size">IF YOU ARE A MICROMANAGER, DO THIS:</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Learn to trust- Each employee has a different way of working. If a person doesn’t work the way you do, it doesn’t mean they are incompetent.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Focus on the end result- Instead of interrupting the process, give your employees a chance to perform tasks according to them. If the end result doesn’t satisfy you, you can suggest a different approach. But give people a chance.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Let go- We all have and will make mistakes at work, and in fact it is one of the best ways to learn. While judging an employee take both achievements and mistakes into consideration instead of just focusing on the mistakes. Try not to label employees as incompetent just on the basis of a few mistakes.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Communicate your basic expectations from the employees and ask them to work towards meeting them.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Ask for feedback from the employees on your leadership.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Try to revisit your non-managerial days.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Sometimes the reason people micromanage is because they have been micromanaged by their managers. We learn from our experiences and if this is the only experience your manager have had then it is going to be difficult for them to not replicate it. Be patient and help your manager realize what they are doing is not serving the purpose.</p>

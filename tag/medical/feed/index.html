<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hi, I am Urja and I am in the final year of dentistry. Choosing a field in medicine was the easiest decision of my life. I am a doctor and I enjoy helping people. Other than that, I am an ambivert and I love to party! I have a degree in Bharatnatyam, I was an athlete in school and still enjoy sports, and I am always up for learning new things. Thanks to quarantine, I learned to do digital art!</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>1.<em>How would you explain your stem field to young girls?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We are the teeth doctors! We specialise in oral health and diagnose oral diseases. We create treatment plans for patients and help maintain or restore their oral health, we also take x-rays, monitor growth and development of teeth/jaws, and perform surgeries if necessary. In short, we help you keep your mouth happy.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>2</strong>.<strong> <em>Why did you choose your STEM field? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My dad‚Äôs an Orthopaedic surgeon, watching him treat people and earn respect had an effect on me. Well, it was either that or MR‚Äôs gifts (just kidding). I decided to study MBBS but getting admission for medical is definitely not a piece of cake. Unfortunately, while I was preparing for my entrance, government changed rules and the admission process was going to be based solely on NEET. This was really important to me but at the same time I was running short on prep time. The pressure was real and unfortunately I got hit by anxiety. Long story short, I pushed through and got myself a nice seat for dentistry and I am enjoying this field ever since.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>3. </strong><em><strong>What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">What is usually the first thing you notice in a person? Smile. So I guess one of the coolest things that people in my profession do is smile designing. We also treat defects or disabilities that people are born with or get due to some disease. We assist in something known as ‚Äúhabit breaking‚Äù- believe me, it is exactly what it sounds like. We help patients break habits like thumb sucking, tongue thrusting and so on. And as a dentist, I am really proud of this last one- we promote anti-tabocco campaigns.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>4. </strong><em><strong>What keeps you going in your profession?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I strongly believe that one of the worst pains in human body is tooth ache, so it makes me happy to offer my help for relieving that pain. It warms my heart when I see a smile back on my patient‚Äôs faces. My work gives me tremendous satisfaction and my happy patients is what keeps me going.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>5. </strong><em><strong>What goals do you have for the future?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">A lot of people even in the developed countries ignore dental health. I would really like to spread awareness about importance of dental hygiene and help avoid the risk of diseases like oral cancer.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>6. <em>What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Smile changes how a person is pursued. It plays a vital role in developing one‚Äôs personality and yet people underestimate the power of oral health. But guess what, we are here for them. As a dentist you can help people look good and spread awareness about dental hygiene. Help us spread smiles <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hi, my name is Ea, and I am a first year PhD candidate studying Applied Biological Chemistry at Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology (TUAT). I did undergrad in Chemistry from Visayas State University in Leyte, Philippines and Master’s degree in Agriculture from TUAT. As a PhD candidate I am working on glycoproteins found in central nervous system. Funny story, as I take hundreds of photos of the brain, I was inspired to convert these pictures into art as a project called Experiments in Art (EA). With this I hope to start a trend where artists use science as inspiration and scientists can look at their work in a different way.</p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>1. How would you describe your role?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I study glycans (polysaccharides), specifically those that bonds to glycoproteins. With the help of different chemical tools that we have developed in the lab, we study how these glycoproteins change in the brain especially in the node of Ranvier, which are unmyelinated regions in the axon that are important for fast conduction of nerve impulses.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>2. What are some challenges you have faced in this research?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I grew up in Leyte, Philippines so as much as the environment was nurturing for my growth as a student there weren’t enough opportunities like exposure to other  scientists or science programs as there are in Manila or some place else. The research opportunities were limited as the labs were not fully advanced, and for students in the province it is a big hindering factor that majority of the programs supported on media and private companies are only in Manila. And now that I&#8217;m in Japan working on my PhD, language barrier is proving to be a challenge since I spend a lot of time in Japanese laboratory. However, my lab mates and professor are very supportive, so this helps me cope with this challenge.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>3. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Funny you should ask, because both my parents are scientists. My dad is a Biochemist and my mom is a Soil Scientist. Growing up I was always exposed to science and my first experiment was making antibacterial soap with my dad using flowers near my school for an elementary science fair. We won first place. Personally, I think it was definitely a way for me and my dad to bond, and my mom was also very supportive so it wasn’t hard to fall in love with the field.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I would say the biggest influence were definitely be my parents, followed by my high school and elementary science teachers. First time I heard “molecular biology” was freshmen year in high school and I just remember being so amazed with that word. I didn’t pursue the major during college but now with my work as a biological chemistry PhD candidate, I’m using molecular biology techniques.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">To sum this up, I love working in the lab, and I also loved researching as a kid..so this and support from my folks and university proved to be very influential for me in choosing this very STEM discipline.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>4. What’s the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are multiple ways of entering this field so I am not quite sure which one&#8217;s the best. I was fortunate enough to grow up in a family that is in academia. Both my parents are professors and my dad is in the same field as me. For grade school, I did experiments on antibacterial soap using flowers near my school, in high school I studied about proteolytic properties of local plant species and how it can be related to Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, in undergrad I was a Chemistry major and my thesis was on the alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity of indigenous plant species in the Philippines and how it can be related to Diabetes.&nbsp;So I guess what I am trying to say here is that I was exposed to lab environment at a very young age and my parents supported me in every step which I think played a big role and that encouraged me to work hard and aim for higher education. Since I am still very new in my career I am not yet fit to say what it takes to be successful but based on what I&#8217;ve learned so far, grit and perseverance paired with curiosity and creativity goes a long way. One might face failures and frustrating moments on a regular basis but the best thing to do is to just scratch that mistake and go back to the drawing board.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>5. What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We work on cell biology, elucidating protein crystal structure using X-ray crystallography (super cool technique that allows us to see the 3D structure of a protein and how it interacts with different molecules), brain research, genome editing, modifying proteins so they are expressed more which is important in medicine, food, and fuel industries.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>6. What keeps you going in your research? What’s next for your career?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are a lot of things that helps me to keep going in my research but to name a few, a supportive lab group, interesting research topic, and of course full scholarship definitely plays a big role.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">After my PhD, I am eyeing on going back to Philippines to help develop STEM fields in the country and to strengthen the collaboration between Filipino and Japanese universities.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>7. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Grit, willingness to learn, hard work, confidence and relationships that we build with people can help us move forward in STEM. There may be less women in STEM right now but that should not discourage us from being in the field. The advantage of being&nbsp;less in number is that it means there are still many spaces to fill, and as a woman in STEM, I encourage you girls to fill that space! Collaboration is key, for men and women alike. As long as we keep this in mind, we can build a symbiotic relationship with men and I hope this encourages us girls to share our ideas knowing that our thoughts as women are very much needed. A raise of the hand in a conference, an e-mail to a professor stating your intention to work in lab, writing that application letter, googling &#8220;scholarships for developing countries&#8221;, picking one that is applicable to you, asking your colleagues to help you apply for grad school. Sometimes the guts to initiate is all it takes to get into STEM.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>8. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Past generations have worked hard to provide women a platform to be visible and heard in STEM and related fields. There is no need to be intimidated anymore. If you feel like STEM is something you want to pursue, go for it! Find a role model or be your own. The perspective of a woman is important in STEM not only for representation but because our brains can offer insights that will compliment that of men, and this is important for the progression of knowledge and learning.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hi, I am Ami and I am a Biomedical and Instrumentation engineer. I am originally from India but have been living in the US with my husband and a toddler for quite some time. Back in India, I have worked as a service engineer and a bio-medical (a.k.a clinical) engineer for different companies and hospitals. Apart from that I enjoy cooking, traveling and occasional hiking. I have a degree in HR management and used to tutor kids in Math. Now after a long professional gap, I have decided to pursue Masters.</p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>1. What is your specific area of STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Engineering- I am a biomedical and instrumentation engineer.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>2. How would you explain your STEM field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a person who has years of experience in this field, I can boldly say that it is one of the most interesting and exciting fields one can study, research and work in. Biomedical and instrumentation engineers design medical equipments and devices like artificial organs, body parts and machines for diagnosing health related complexities.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>3. What are some challenges you face in this field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a biomedical engineer the biggest challenge that I&#8217;ve faced is dealing with the customers. In my experience, providing technical support involves on-site visits, working cross-functionally across teams, managing and staying up-to-date with inventories and nudging customers in the right direction to get a product or part that will suit their needs. But what I love the most about my role is that I get to work with customers and help them with a cost-effective equipment planning solution.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>4. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Physics and Math have always interested me. I love the challenges that science and technology throws at us. One day I just thought to myself, how incredible would it be to do something that could change or save lives? Biomedical and instrumentation engineering gave me the chance to do something meaningful with my life. I would say the field itself has proven to be an inspiration to me.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>5. What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Engineers in my profession put great effort in designing and successfully building artificial organs like kidneys, hearts, legs, joints, blood vessels and so on. We also build devices like pacemaker and hearing aids and provide support with it&#8217;s installation, maintenance and educate customers on it&#8217;s usage.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>6. You mentioned continuing your education after a long gap. How does it feel to get back in STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Honestly, I am really excited. It&#8217;s definitely going to be a bit of a challenge since I have a one year old to take care of but nevertheless, I feel empowered. I worked hard to get admission in graduate school- I even joined community college and started working on a field-related course. I manage home and take care of my kid and once my husband gets back from work, I take some time for myself and focus on the course. Over the past months I gained new skills and brushed some old ones. I feel inspired.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>7. What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am completely aware of the gender parity issue in STEM. Things are getting better but I firmly believe that we need more role models to rectify the fact and correct me if I am wrong, we as women have to work harder than men for gaining trust and respect of people in our field.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>8. What message would you like to give to our STEM moms?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As moms we face enough challenges every day, add education and it becomes a whole new level of juggling. It is important to stay positive and focus on the goods rather than the challenges because one day or the other your degree is going to open a whole new window of opportunities. One thing to remember and I don&#8217;t mean to sound cheeky- we are women. We have the ultimate gift of multi-tasking. So to all my ladies, brace up and conquer the world. All you need is a will and a dash of courage. Age is no bar and your kids are your strength, don&#8217;t stop pursuing your goals by making them your weakness.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size">My career journey has taken me on a complete rollercoaster of a ride to get to where I am today.<br><br>From the age of 10 it was my dream to join Cirque du Soleil, I travelled all around Australia on tour with the circus, whilst undertaking the same schooling as any normal kid. In my graduating year I got injured, and I came to the realisation that I needed a plan B.<br><br>This led me to studying Business and Accounting at university, I fell in love with studying and left my circus dreams behind. I naturally excelled at Accounting which subsequently led me to believe this was the career for me. I studied part time and worked part time at a tax accounting firm, whilst managing 4 other casual jobs.<br><br>By the time I graduated I realised accounting was definitely not for me. Feeling a bit lost I found myself starting up a recruitment division in Melbourne specialising in Salesforce. After almost a year into my role I caught myself spending more time learning about Salesforce and Marc Benioff then actually recruiting. So I took one day off and did what I knew best and that was to recruit. I called all the companies in Australia that specialised in Salesforce implementations and sold myself in as a junior candidate.<br><br>Before I knew it I was working for a Platinum Salesforce Marketing Cloud partner, learning to code and configure the platform for our customers.<br><br>At this point I started my side hustle FIIT Collective, and 2 years later joined Salesforce.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">2. <strong><em>How would you explain your STEM field?</em></strong><br>In my full time role at Salesforce I support Account Executives in the pre-sales cycle. I spend a lot of my time understanding the business challenges organisations face, and solution design how the Salesforce platform can help overcome those challenges. As a part of my role I need to understand the full technical capability of the Salesforce platform as well as, implementation best practices and industry trends relevant to the customers I am working with. &nbsp;<br>As a founder of a small business supporting women in tech, I feel the responsibility to help close the gender gap in tech. It’s my dream to live in a world where diversity and inclusion is second nature, and society no longer uses labels such as “Female CEO”, just CEO. Where women feel confident in applying for jobs when they only meeting a fraction of requirements, in the same way men do. A world where women can be their authentic self at work, and leverage their female superpowers, rather than adopting male characteristics. And most importantly for women to know they can “have it all” and do not have to choose between motherhood, or their career.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">3. <strong><em>What are some challenges you face in this field?</em></strong><br>You’re often considered as the smartest person in the room, with that I find myself putting pressure on myself to know everything &#8211; which is completely unrealistic.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">4. <strong><em>What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong><br>I honestly fell into it. It wasn’t planned… I have always followed my passion and that led me to the great success I have had today.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">5. <strong><em>What’s the best way to enter your field?</em></strong><br>I honestly believe aptitude and attitude go so much further then your technical knowledge. You can teach tech, you can’t teach attitude.<br>What helped me land my role at Salesforce was enthusiasm and specialisation. I saw opportunities in the market very early on to specialise in a platform that very little people knew about. I took a calculated risk, knowing that this specialisation would sky-rocket my career when the market demanded for this skillset.<br>I was right, this skill set along with my hunger to learn helped me land my dream job.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br>6. <strong><em>What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong><br>I love that every single day is different&#8230; and with technology rapidly advancing each day, it requires me as a solution engineer to keep up to date with the latest tech, industry trends and product releases.<br>Outside of my role I have submitted two innovations to the US patent office which is pretty cool.<br>I also get to present a lot at events, about our latest innovations&#8230;<br></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">&nbsp;7. <strong><em>What keeps you going in your profession?</em><br></strong>I am very aligned to my purpose which is to empower and educate females in tech to live a more purposeful career and life. Every single day I get to pursue that purpose in both my day job and side hustle.<br>When you know your purpose you’re intrinsically motivated and don’t need external factors to keep you on track and productive.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><br>8. <strong><em>What is FIIT Collective?</em></strong><br>It’s a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fiitcollective.com/" target="_blank">platform to educate and empower women in tech to live a more purposeful career and life</a>. It all started with my <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/tamarajohanna_/" target="_blank">instagram</a>, then progressed into a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://fiitcollective.com/" target="_blank">female in tech blog</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/the-females-in-tech-show-with-tamara-johanna/id1479316259" target="_blank">podcast</a>. Soon I will be releasing e-learning products and webinars to help women accelerate their career in tech.<br></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">9. <strong><em>What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in STEM?</em></strong><br>Being a blonde female, I sometimes find it challenging to be taken seriously in customer meetings. People subconsciously judge me for being female, and at times question my technical capability because of the way I look. I used to take this personally, but now I use it to my advantage…&nbsp;<br></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">10. <strong><em>What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong><br>Personal branding played a big role in the success I have had today. I didn’t have the luxury of having family connections to get into big tech or consulting corporate giants&#8230;&nbsp; I had to find my own way into my dream company, and I did that through my personal brand.<br>Regardless if you have these internal connections or not, your personal brand will help you get the salary and promotions you deserve.&nbsp;<br>I encourage you to take time out weekly to build your personal brand and become a thought leader with people inside and outside of your workplace. You never know where your next opportunity might be…</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size">My name is Nicole Young and I am a developer and freelancer based in Pennsylvania, USA.&nbsp; I got into tech after I graduated from college with a degree in Psychology. I was planning on accepting an offer for a PhD but instead was given the opportunity to go to Malaysia for a year for an academic grant to teach English. When I returned, I wanted to continue to pursue opportunities where I could be more hands on and found a job at a tech startup. I learned so much in the two year that I was there and was introduced to coding and resources that inevitably helped me to teach myself development and start freelancing.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>1.What is your specific area of STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am a technologist. Not only am I a developer but I also pay attention to the trends, patterns and practices of the industry. I think that it is important to do that no matter the field.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>2.How would you explain your STEM field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I use my skills to help people build an online presence so that they can reach the people that they want to help. I build websites and provide other services to help people make a good impression online.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>3.What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I was inspired by the work that I was doing in my first job and inspired by all of the new things that I was learning. I chose Tech because it felt right to me. It was where I felt like I could make the largest impact.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>4.What’s the best way to enter your field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">No matter what age you are right now there are ways that you can start getting in to tech and coding right now! There are lots of games and websites geared toward helping young people understand how to code and build the problem solving skills that they need to be successful at it.&nbsp; Take some time to explore the websites and social media platforms that you are on everyday and learn a bit about how they are made. It will definitely amaze you!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>5.What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Anything that you can access on the web right now was built by someone with a development or engineering skill set, Developers like me work each day to create the cool websites, software, games and social media platforms that we all know and love!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>6.What keeps you going in your profession?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Keep a steady habit of learning is important and keeps me going. Also staying curious and wanting to push myself to create new and awesome things keeps me interested in what I do.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>7.What are your future career goals?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I would like to start my own organization where I help other women and people of color learn new tech skills for free where they can be placed in jobs that will give them new opportunities to learn a high paying skill.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>8.What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in stem?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It can feel lonely at times. I am often the only woman of color in the spaces that I am in and it can feel isolating and discouraging. There is also things like imposter syndrome (not feeling like I belong or am qualified enough to do what I do) and the feeling that I have to prove myself to those around me more than everyone else does.&nbsp; Those all can take a toll on you mentally and emotionally, which can make it tough to move forward sometimes.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>9.What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Stay curious and focused on your goals. Experiment and never be afraid to try new things.&nbsp; I think there is a lot of pressure on young people to have their lives figured out before they entered the real world and I want whoever is reading to know &#8211; that’s not true! It will take time but keep chasing the things that fill you with joy and fire because those things will lead you to what is best for you!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hello! I&#8217;m Daisy and I&#8217;m an experimental quantum physics PhD candidate at the University of Surrey&#8217;s Advanced&nbsp;Technology Institute.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I&#8217;ve been interested in science for as long as I can remember, although I also have a passion for art and  was torn between pursuing art or science as a career. I eventually settled on science and opted to keep my creative pursuits as hobbies. What I&#8217;ve come to realise is that to be a scientist and a researcher you need to be creative so that side of me comes in handy when I&#8217;m solving problems and designing new experiments. Once I&#8217;d decided to do science I then had to decide which one! I knew I had more interest in the physical sciences and as physics was my favourite&nbsp;subject from when I was 16, I opted to do a physics degree.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">During the later years of high school, I had a lot of trouble with socialising and developed&nbsp;major depressive disorder and generalised anxiety disorder. It wasn&#8217;t until near the end of my degree that I was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and my challenges since high school began to make sense. I now have autism-specific support at my university and speak openly about the challenges and strengths of being autistic. During my degree, I had the opportunity to do a year of research for my master&#8217;s project so I applied to be a research and development intern at the Centre for Integrated Photonics where I worked on designing and testing semiconductor lasers for telecommunications applications. After graduating from my MPhys, I applied to do PhDs in quantum technologies and I started my PhD in 2018 working on a project on &#8216;development of InSb quantum point contacts for quantum technology applications&#8217;. I absolutely love my research and regularly talk about it as well as my experience as an autistic person in STEM and academia on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/notesfromthephysicslab/"><em>social media</em></a> and my <a href="https://www.notesfromthephysicslab.com/links"><em>blog</em></a>.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em><strong>1.What is your specific area of STEM?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My current sub-field is semiconductor spintronics. This falls under the larger field of quantum technologies. These fields are quite interdisciplinary with physicists, materials scientists, engineers and chemists all working within it. I approach my work from the perspective of experimental quantum physics, so I get to delve into the fundamental quantum physics phenomenon as well as looking at the fabrication and engineering side of things.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em><strong>2.How would you explain your STEM field?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Semiconductor spintronics is a field which looks at exploiting electron spin in semiconductor materials for quantum technology applications. Let me break down all that jargon a bit: Semiconductors are a group of materials which can sometimes behave like a conductor and sometimes like an insulator. They have highly &#8216;tunable&#8217; properties and are the materials used in most technology these days. All of the transistors and other components in your phone and computer are made from predominantly semiconductor materials. They also make up a lot of the telecommunications infrastructure as semiconductors can be used to make lasers and other optical devices such as LEDs. Spintronics is short for &#8216;spin transport electronics&#8217; and it essentially is an extension of electronics. In electronics, we use the charge of electrons in materials to make technology and spintronics extends that to include an additional degree of freedom: spin. One of the most interesting applications of spintronics is in quantum computing where it is a key concept for solid-state electron spin qubits. My current research looks at ways to produce a current of electrons with a particular spin state using nanostructures made from semiconductor quantum wells which can be used to initialize&nbsp;spin-based qubits.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>3.What are some challenges you face in this field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It&#8217;s a very new field so there are still lots of things we don&#8217;t know. But in a way, this is what makes it exciting! More generally, I have some challenges with my communication and processing differences due to being autistic but I&#8217;m developing great self-advocacy skills to enable me to work to the best of my ability (and this isn&#8217;t really a field-specific challenge, just more of a general life challenge).</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>4.What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My decision to get into quantum physics comes from a class in high school. In chemistry, we were learning about electron shells in atoms and the concept of electron spin was mentioned. I instantly became fascinated with what this meant and asked my teacher who told me to ask a physics teacher. I did and since then had a fascination with quantum physics and the concept of spin. In fact, applied quantum physics is one of my longest-standing autistic &#8216;special interests&#8217; which is why I am so drawn to it as a career. I&#8217;ve also been very inspired by the incredible Emmy Noether since high school and find her to be such a role model for trailblazing women in physics and mathematics.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>5.What’s the best way to enter your field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I don&#8217;t think there is one particular &#8216;best&#8217; route for anything really. If you want to be a quantum physicist I do think you need a good grounding in physics&#8211; whether that is a degree or an apprenticeship (for example, the National Physical Laboratory offers science apprenticeships).&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>6.What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There&#8217;s always so much amazing research coming out of quantum technology! Probably the most notable is the recent work from Google reaching &#8216;quantum supremacy&#8217;. Although there is a lot of hype around it, we still have a long way to go (decades probably) until we see anything resembling a functioning, commercially viable quantum computer.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>7.What keeps you going in your profession?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Knowing that I am part of the research effort towards new technologies which help advance progress in a whole host of disciplines.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>8.What are your future career goals?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I would like to be working in quantum technology R&amp;D, whether that is in academia or industry. I&#8217;d also like to develop my science communication freelance work so that I can help educate people on physics online as well as raise awareness about topics I&#8217;m passionate about such as making STEM more accessible to disabled people.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>9.What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I stick out within my research group due to my gender. I hope that in the future this isn&#8217;t the case but not many women progress to senior positions in physics and I&#8217;m very aware of that. Sometimes there are comments about my gender which strike me as odd because surely the most important thing about my academic work is the quality of my research, not my gender!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>10.What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you have a passion for STEM then go for it. Contrary to stereotypes, you don&#8217;t need to be anything apart from curious, determined and have a thirst for knowledge to work in STEM fields!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hi, I am Urja and I am in the final year of dentistry. Choosing a field in medicine was the easiest decision of my life. I am a doctor and I enjoy helping people. Other than that, I am an ambivert and I love to party! I have a degree in Bharatnatyam, I was an athlete in school and still enjoy sports, and I am always up for learning new things. Thanks to quarantine, I learned to do digital art!</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>1.<em>How would you explain your stem field to young girls?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We are the teeth doctors! We specialise in oral health and diagnose oral diseases. We create treatment plans for patients and help maintain or restore their oral health, we also take x-rays, monitor growth and development of teeth/jaws, and perform surgeries if necessary. In short, we help you keep your mouth happy.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>2</strong>.<strong> <em>Why did you choose your STEM field? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My dad’s an Orthopaedic surgeon, watching him treat people and earn respect had an effect on me. Well, it was either that or MR’s gifts (just kidding). I decided to study MBBS but getting admission for medical is definitely not a piece of cake. Unfortunately, while I was preparing for my entrance, government changed rules and the admission process was going to be based solely on NEET. This was really important to me but at the same time I was running short on prep time. The pressure was real and unfortunately I got hit by anxiety. Long story short, I pushed through and got myself a nice seat for dentistry and I am enjoying this field ever since.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>3. </strong><em><strong>What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">What is usually the first thing you notice in a person? Smile. So I guess one of the coolest things that people in my profession do is smile designing. We also treat defects or disabilities that people are born with or get due to some disease. We assist in something known as “habit breaking”- believe me, it is exactly what it sounds like. We help patients break habits like thumb sucking, tongue thrusting and so on. And as a dentist, I am really proud of this last one- we promote anti-tabocco campaigns.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>4. </strong><em><strong>What keeps you going in your profession?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I strongly believe that one of the worst pains in human body is tooth ache, so it makes me happy to offer my help for relieving that pain. It warms my heart when I see a smile back on my patient’s faces. My work gives me tremendous satisfaction and my happy patients is what keeps me going.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>5. </strong><em><strong>What goals do you have for the future?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">A lot of people even in the developed countries ignore dental health. I would really like to spread awareness about importance of dental hygiene and help avoid the risk of diseases like oral cancer.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>6. <em>What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Smile changes how a person is pursued. It plays a vital role in developing one’s personality and yet people underestimate the power of oral health. But guess what, we are here for them. As a dentist you can help people look good and spread awareness about dental hygiene. Help us spread smiles <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

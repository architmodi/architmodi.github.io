<p class="has-medium-font-size">I’m a Nigerian-American Software Engineer based in the New York City Area. I also am a co-founder and COO of MacScientits, a publication aimed at uplifting women of color in STEM and founder and CEO of Creatic Ventures, a digital creative studio providing website design and system optimization services for digital service providers and content creators. I graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Pittsburgh and love traveling, running, and doing yoga.</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>1. What is your specific area of STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am a Software Engineer and I work on building new features for mobile and desktop applications.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>2. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">When I was little, I was always the kid who was curious about how computers worked. Fast-forwarding to when it was time to apply to college I felt that it just made sense to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering. I explored other types of engineering disciplines but realized that I wanted to just apply computer engineering principles to them.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>3. What’s the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There’s so many ways to enter the tech industry. Whether you pursue a traditional or non-traditional route, it is important that you have a good understanding of data structures and algorithms because that is what employers are looking for when you interview. If coding isn’t your strong suit, there are many other jobs such as project management, design, and product management that are also ways of getting into the industry. I would say focus on your interests and let that carry you into your next tech job. </p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>4. What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">People in my field are building a lot of the tools that you use today! If you have a cellphone, use a computer, or anything involving a code/software script, software engineers played a vital part in building them. As a software engineer you have the capability to make an impact on millions of people across the world.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>5. What keeps you going in your profession? What’s next for your career?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">What keeps me going is my quest for knowledge. I still feel like there’s so much that I don’t know and I’m excited to learn more and dive deeper. For my career I want to dive deeper into becoming an industry leader for my technical abilities. </p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>6. What is it like to be a woman in STEM? What are some challenges that you have faced?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">If I am being completely honest, it can be a little isolating and discouraging at times. I struggled a lot with not finding people who could relate to me and to connect with in my classes. When I started working I felt a lot of imposter syndrome and struggled to feel like I belonged or that I was valued. That being said, I found a strong sense of community with my friends outside of the classroom and sought to find a work environment where I felt much appreciated and considered. </p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>7. What are 3 things that you wish could change about STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I wish I could change the lack of diversity within STEM fields  as well as the barriers to enter this field. A lot of jobs in STEM require you to have some sort of formalized education which isn’t always accessible to everyone. Additionally, I would want to change the way there’s so much elitism to be studying STEM. I hated when professors would call a class a “weed out” class. Why are you trying to weed people out? STEM should be inclusive. </p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>8. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Exposure! Seeing more people who look like you pursuing a career in STEM as well as finding fun and creative ways to learn about science provides an excellent avenue to get more girls involved and interested. </p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#df6b6b;"><em>9. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">You can do it! It can be hard sometimes, but don’t get discouraged. There’s so much to learn and there’s so many different paths. You can make it work for you.</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size">Have you been micromanaged by someone? Turns out more than half of the working population in the world has experienced micromanagement. So there is a 50/50 possibility that you have been through it. Certainly, this is something neither the employees nor the employer is proud of. Often micromanagement kills productivity since no one likes someone breathing down their necks all the time. This is going to bring the efficiency down and create an unhealthy work environment for the employees. But what causes micromanagement? Doubts about employee’s competency, urge to be in control all the time, detail-oriented and much more which we will discuss shortly.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-yellow-background-color has-background has-medium-font-size">SIGNS YOU ARE BEING MICROMANAGED</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />You are being asked to provide frequent updates.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Even the simplest decision is questioned by the manager.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />You feel being controlled most of the times.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />You are losing confidence.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />You are always worrying about how the manager will react.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-yellow-background-color has-background has-medium-font-size">IF YOU ARE BEING MICROMANAGED, DO THIS:</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Gain the micromanager’s trust- Prove that you are capable of handling things on your own.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Document everything you do- I learned this from my mentor and it has personally helped me.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Meet deadlines.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Keep the micromanager in loop in case of any changes. It is important to anticipate a situation and provide updates upfront at least in the beginning to help them with the whole trust process.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Ask for feedback from the manager about your performance.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Communicate how you feel- Usually micromanagers are not aware that they are micromanaging. People try to improve efficiency but end up becoming controlling. There is a thin line between being detail-oriented and obsessive, and unfortunately employees are the ones realizing it first. Let the manager know how this is in fact affecting your efficiency and mental health in your next 1:1.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-yellow-background-color has-background has-medium-font-size">IF YOU ARE A MICROMANAGER, DO THIS:</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Learn to trust- Each employee has a different way of working. If a person doesn’t work the way you do, it doesn’t mean they are incompetent.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Focus on the end result- Instead of interrupting the process, give your employees a chance to perform tasks according to them. If the end result doesn’t satisfy you, you can suggest a different approach. But give people a chance.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Let go- We all have and will make mistakes at work, and in fact it is one of the best ways to learn. While judging an employee take both achievements and mistakes into consideration instead of just focusing on the mistakes. Try not to label employees as incompetent just on the basis of a few mistakes.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Communicate your basic expectations from the employees and ask them to work towards meeting them.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Ask for feedback from the employees on your leadership.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Try to revisit your non-managerial days.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Sometimes the reason micromanagers micromanage is because they have been micromanaged by their managers. We learn from our experiences and if this is the only experience your manager have had then it is going to be difficult for them to not replicate it. Be patient and help your manager realize what they are doing is not serving the purpose.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-normal-font-size">My name is Nicole Young and I am a developer and freelancer based in Pennsylvania, USA.  I got into tech after I graduated from college with a degree in Psychology. I was planning on accepting an offer for a PhD but instead was given the opportunity to go to Malaysia for a year for an academic grant to teach English. When I returned, I wanted to continue to pursue opportunities where I could be more hands on and found a job at a tech startup. I learned so much in the two year that I was there and was introduced to coding and resources that inevitably helped me to teach myself development and start freelancing.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>1.What is your specific area of STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I am a technologist. Not only am I a developer but I also pay attention to the trends, patterns and practices of the industry. I think that it is important to do that no matter the field.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>2.How would you explain your STEM field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I use my skills to help people build an online presence so that they can reach the people that they want to help. I build websites and provide other services to help people make a good impression online. </p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>3.What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I was inspired by the work that I was doing in my first job and inspired by all of the new things that I was learning. I chose Tech because it felt right to me. It was where I felt like I could make the largest impact.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>4.What’s the best way to enter your field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">No matter what age you are right now there are ways that you can start getting in to tech and coding right now! There are lots of games and websites geared toward helping young people understand how to code and build the problem solving skills that they need to be successful at it.  Take some time to explore the websites and social media platforms that you are on everyday and learn a bit about how they are made. It will definitely amaze you!</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>5.What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Anything that you can access on the web right now was built by someone with a development or engineering skill set, Developers like me work each day to create the cool websites, software, games and social media platforms that we all know and love!</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>6.What keeps you going in your profession?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Keep a steady habit of learning is important and keeps me going. Also staying curious and wanting to push myself to create new and awesome things keeps me interested in what I do.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>7.What are your future career goals?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I would like to start my own organization where I help other women and people of color learn new tech skills for free where they can be placed in jobs that will give them new opportunities to learn a high paying skill.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>8.What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in stem?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">It can feel lonely at times. I am often the only woman of color in the spaces that I am in and it can feel isolating and discouraging. There is also things like imposter syndrome (not feeling like I belong or am qualified enough to do what I do) and the feeling that I have to prove myself to those around me more than everyone else does.  Those all can take a toll on you mentally and emotionally, which can make it tough to move forward sometimes.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>9.What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Stay curious and focused on your goals. Experiment and never be afraid to try new things.  I think there is a lot of pressure on young people to have their lives figured out before they entered the real world and I want whoever is reading to know &#8211; that’s not true! It will take time but keep chasing the things that fill you with joy and fire because those things will lead you to what is best for you!</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size">Hello! I&#8217;m Daisy and I&#8217;m an experimental quantum physics PhD candidate at the University of Surrey&#8217;s Advanced&nbsp;Technology Institute.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I&#8217;ve been interested in science for as long as I can remember, although I also have a passion for art and  was torn between pursuing art or science as a career. I eventually settled on science and opted to keep my creative pursuits as hobbies. What I&#8217;ve come to realise is that to be a scientist and a researcher you need to be creative so that side of me comes in handy when I&#8217;m solving problems and designing new experiments. Once I&#8217;d decided to do science I then had to decide which one! I knew I had more interest in the physical sciences and as physics was my favourite&nbsp;subject from when I was 16, I opted to do a physics degree.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">During the later years of high school, I had a lot of trouble with socialising and developed major depressive disorder and generalised anxiety disorder. It wasn&#8217;t until near the end of my degree that I was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and my challenges since high school began to make sense. I now have autism-specific support at my university and speak openly about the challenges and strengths of being autistic. During my degree, I had the opportunity to do a year of research for my master&#8217;s project so I applied to be a research and development intern at the Centre for Integrated Photonics where I worked on designing and testing semiconductor lasers for telecommunications applications. After graduating from my MPhys, I applied to do PhDs in quantum technologies and I started my PhD in 2018 working on a project on &#8216;development of InSb quantum point contacts for quantum technology applications&#8217;. I absolutely love my research and regularly talk about it as well as my experience as an autistic person in STEM and academia on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/notesfromthephysicslab/"><em>social media</em></a> and my <a href="https://www.notesfromthephysicslab.com/links"><em>blog</em></a>.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><em><strong>1.What is your specific area of STEM?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">My current sub-field is semiconductor spintronics. This falls under the larger field of quantum technologies. These fields are quite interdisciplinary with physicists, materials scientists, engineers and chemists all working within it. I approach my work from the perspective of experimental quantum physics, so I get to delve into the fundamental quantum physics phenomenon as well as looking at the fabrication and engineering side of things.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><em><strong>2.How would you explain your STEM field?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Semiconductor spintronics is a field which looks at exploiting electron spin in semiconductor materials for quantum technology applications. Let me break down all that jargon a bit: Semiconductors are a group of materials which can sometimes behave like a conductor and sometimes like an insulator. They have highly &#8216;tunable&#8217; properties and are the materials used in most technology these days. All of the transistors and other components in your phone and computer are made from predominantly semiconductor materials. They also make up a lot of the telecommunications infrastructure as semiconductors can be used to make lasers and other optical devices such as LEDs. Spintronics is short for &#8216;spin transport electronics&#8217; and it essentially is an extension of electronics. In electronics, we use the charge of electrons in materials to make technology and spintronics extends that to include an additional degree of freedom: spin. One of the most interesting applications of spintronics is in quantum computing where it is a key concept for solid-state electron spin qubits. My current research looks at ways to produce a current of electrons with a particular spin state using nanostructures made from semiconductor quantum wells which can be used to initialize&nbsp;spin-based qubits.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>3.What are some challenges you face in this field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">It&#8217;s a very new field so there are still lots of things we don&#8217;t know. But in a way, this is what makes it exciting! More generally, I have some challenges with my communication and processing differences due to being autistic but I&#8217;m developing great self-advocacy skills to enable me to work to the best of my ability (and this isn&#8217;t really a field-specific challenge, just more of a general life challenge).</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>4.What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">My decision to get into quantum physics comes from a class in high school. In chemistry, we were learning about electron shells in atoms and the concept of electron spin was mentioned. I instantly became fascinated with what this meant and asked my teacher who told me to ask a physics teacher. I did and since then had a fascination with quantum physics and the concept of spin. In fact, applied quantum physics is one of my longest-standing autistic &#8216;special interests&#8217; which is why I am so drawn to it as a career. I&#8217;ve also been very inspired by the incredible Emmy Noether since high school and find her to be such a role model for trailblazing women in physics and mathematics.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>5.What’s the best way to enter your field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I don&#8217;t think there is one particular &#8216;best&#8217; route for anything really. If you want to be a quantum physicist I do think you need a good grounding in physics&#8211; whether that is a degree or an apprenticeship (for example, the National Physical Laboratory offers science apprenticeships).&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>6.What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">There&#8217;s always so much amazing research coming out of quantum technology! Probably the most notable is the recent work from Google reaching &#8216;quantum supremacy&#8217;. Although there is a lot of hype around it, we still have a long way to go (decades probably) until we see anything resembling a functioning, commercially viable quantum computer.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>7.What keeps you going in your profession?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Knowing that I am part of the research effort towards new technologies which help advance progress in a whole host of disciplines.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>8.What are your future career goals?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I would like to be working in quantum technology R&amp;D, whether that is in academia or industry. I&#8217;d also like to develop my science communication freelance work so that I can help educate people on physics online as well as raise awareness about topics I&#8217;m passionate about such as making STEM more accessible to disabled people.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>9.What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I stick out within my research group due to my gender. I hope that in the future this isn&#8217;t the case but not many women progress to senior positions in physics and I&#8217;m very aware of that. Sometimes there are comments about my gender which strike me as odd because surely the most important thing about my academic work is the quality of my research, not my gender!</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>10.What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">If you have a passion for STEM then go for it. Contrary to stereotypes, you don&#8217;t need to be anything apart from curious, determined and have a thirst for knowledge to work in STEM fields!</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size">Hi! My name is Shreya and I’m a full time backend software developer based in San Diego, California. I’m an active member of the Lean In Women In Tech community here and can be found speaking at the occasional tech event as an advocate for minorities in tech. Prior to this, I’ve worked at various corporations around the Silicon Valley in California. I hold a degree in bioinformatics from the University of California San Diego.</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size">1.<em><strong>What</strong></em> <strong><em>is your specific area of STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I work as a software engineer within the tech industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">2.<strong><em>What is the best way to enter your field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">One of the great things about software engineering is that there’s never just one way to do things! This includes breaking in. The most traditional option is to get a 4 year undergraduate degree in computer science and apply for software engineering internships along the way, culminating in a full time job as a software developer after college. But this definitely isn’t the only way! There are coding boot camps worth looking in to that teach the skills necessary to become a full-fledged software developer in just a few months. Yet another option is to use an online course platform such as Udemy to self-tech yourself programming and begin freelancing from there!&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">3.<strong><em>What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Software engineers work on every application on your phone! They work on your automated kitchen appliances and your home security system. Even when you’re going to get a drink at Starbucks, you’ve used applications spanning thousands of lines of code! From using your Maps app to get to the store to the application the cashier uses to punch in your order, you’re often using software everywhere without even realizing it!&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">4.<strong><em>What keeps you going in your profession?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Something that I love at my job is that every day is different. Every day I get to solve a new problem that no-one else has worked on before! The more complex the task, the greater feeling of accomplishment at the end of the day.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">5.<strong><em>What are your future career goals?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">As an advocate of minorities in tech, my goal within the tech community is to normalize and start discussions about difficult situations within the workplace. I try to empower others by providing potential solutions to these problems and provide a platform for others to build off of each other and connect.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">In general I divide my goal focuses by category: career, personal skills, financial, and health. My overarching theme for 2020 has been exploration. I’m trying to delve into new ideas with a more open mind.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">My career goals involve broadening my skillset technically as well as non-technically, translating to moving up the engineering ladder.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">6.<strong><em>What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in stem?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">It’s no secret that the odds are stacked up against women in STEM trying to build a successful career. One of the biggest challenges adding on to that is imposter syndrome. The way I define imposter syndrome is when one constantly and repeatedly doubts the legitimacy of their accomplishments and is worried that they don’t deserve to belong or succeed. I face this in waves, usually when in periods of great growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">7.<strong><em>What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">If I can suggest two virtues to develop, they would be clear communication and persistence — these have changed the game for my career and personal life. Just know that if you set your mind to it, you CAN and WILL succeed.</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size">Hi! My name is Mariana and I was born in Colombia. After my family and I survived one of the worst earthquakes in the Colombian history, we moved to Spain to start a new life. We faced struggles settling down but somehow managed to find a place to live and a spot for me in public school. One day, my mother showed me a news article about Dr Anna Veiga, the first scientist in Spain who succeeded in in-vitro fertilization, this urged me to become like her. I was 17 when I realized I wanted to be a medic and gave my best to become one. Unfortunately, I faced anxiety and panic attacks throughout my exams and contests that I participated for getting into medicine. One day, my mother showed me another news article: “ Bioinformatics, the Medicine of the Future”, this inspired me to my core. I recently graduated with a degree in Bioinformatics and currently studying MPhil in Medical Science at the University of Cambridge.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">1. <em>What is your specific area of STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Bioinformatics. It is the art of using computational resources in any scientific field (maths, physics, chemistry, biology and so on). For me, I chose to focus on Medical Sciences and stem cells &#8211; I am currently working at the Haematology department at the University of Cambridge, so the cells I am focused on are blood stem cells.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">2. <em>What goals do you have for the future?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">My short-term goals are to pursue a PhD at the University of Cambridge and to grow as a science communicator on social media to help others to fight for their dreams, especially in stem fields.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">3. <em>What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Our lab is divided between experimentalists and bioinformaticians, and we all work on Haematopoiesis (the study of blood cell types formation). The bioinformaticians work from mathematical models to machine learning and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis. In my case, I’m in the last group: I’m working on developing a computational pipeline for single-cell multimodal analysis (samples obtained using NGS)</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">4. <em>What keeps you going in your field?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I have loved studying stem cells since I was 17! Now I have the chance of using my “futuristic” bioinformatics skills in this field. It’s incredible to know I can keep learning everyday, don&#8217;t you think?</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">5. <em>What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in stem?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Though it is getting better, I still find it very difficult to see gender equality. There still are lack of women in STEM. I remember my first day at the Faculty of Informatics, there was a group of men sitting in the cafe and they whispered, “look, I bet she got lost” &#8211; they were talking about me! The worst mistake is to assume a woman is not capable of pursuing or being interested in STEM fields.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">6. <em>What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I would suggest them not listening to everything that people say. I have been psychologically attacked by narrow-minded people who kept saying that I should remember where I came from and stop dreaming about studying overseas. People have said that I cannot afford higher education in a foreign country, that I cannot get into medicine, and that maybe I should stop thinking about STEM fields. People have said that I am too young to leave home because it seems scary, I have heard them complain of me spending too much time studying instead of having fun (but they have no idea how fun I find my job!). I have experienced this so I can tell you that it’s your time to prove yourself and the world how STRONG you can be. Don’t stop, KEEP DREAMING.</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size">Hi, I am Urja and I am in the final year of dentistry. Choosing a field in medicine was the easiest decision of my life. I am a doctor and I enjoy helping people. Other than that, I am an ambivert and I love to party! I have a degree in Bharatnatyam, I was an athlete in school and still enjoy sports, and I am always up for learning new things. Thanks to quarantine, I learned to do digital art!</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>1.<em>How would you explain your stem field to young girls?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">We are the teeth doctors! We specialise in oral health and diagnose oral diseases. We create treatment plans for patients and help maintain or restore their oral health, we also take x-rays, monitor growth and development of teeth/jaws, and perform surgeries if necessary. In short, we help you keep your mouth happy.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>2</strong>.<strong> <em>Why did you choose your STEM field? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">My dad’s an Orthopaedic surgeon, watching him treat people and earn respect had an effect on me. Well, it was either that or MR’s gifts (just kidding). I decided to study MBBS but getting admission for medical is definitely not a piece of cake. Unfortunately, while I was preparing for my entrance, government changed rules and the admission process was going to be based solely on NEET. This was really important to me but at the same time I was running short on prep time. The pressure was real and unfortunately I got hit by anxiety. Long story short, I pushed through and got myself a nice seat for dentistry and I am enjoying this field ever since.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>3. </strong><em><strong>What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">What is usually the first thing you notice in a person? Smile. So I guess one of the coolest things that people in my profession do is smile designing. We also treat defects or disabilities that people are born with or get due to some disease. We assist in something known as “habit breaking”- believe me, it is exactly what it sounds like. We help patients break habits like thumb sucking, tongue thrusting and so on. And as a dentist, I am really proud of this last one- we promote anti-tabocco campaigns.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>4. </strong><em><strong>What keeps you going in your profession?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I strongly believe that one of the worst pains in human body is tooth ache, so it makes me happy to offer my help for relieving that pain. It warms my heart when I see a smile back on my patient’s faces. My work gives me tremendous satisfaction and my happy patients is what keeps me going.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>5. </strong><em><strong>What goals do you have for the future?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">A lot of people even in the developed countries ignore dental health. I would really like to spread awareness about importance of dental hygiene and help avoid the risk of diseases like oral cancer.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong>6. <em>What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Smile changes how a person is pursued. It plays a vital role in developing one’s personality and yet people underestimate the power of oral health. But guess what, we are here for them. As a dentist you can help people look good and spread awareness about dental hygiene. Help us spread smiles <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

I have a Master&#8217;s degree in Business Analytics and I love reading (check out – ‘Why We Sleep’ and thank me later <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />), calligraphy, and researching about data science. Being a minority, I am always looking for ways to encourage more women in STEM. I also have been a part of Women In Data Science conferences, so here&#8217;s another attempt to do the same.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><strong><em>1.What&#8217;s your story?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I started my career as a software engineer but craved on solving more challenging problems employing cutting-edge technologies. And just then I stumbled upon Masters in Analytics program which was a step ahead of coding. It had an enticing combination of math (one of my early childhood fascinations) and coding for uncovering useful information hidden in data. I jumped at the opportunity and so far this field has never ceased to fascinate me with it&#8217;s advancements.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><em><strong>2. What is your specific area of STEM?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">My focus is Data Science. It is a subset of Artificial Intelligence and includes statistics, probability, coding (Python is the most in-demand, R comes next), and machine learning.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><em><strong>3. How would you explain your STEM field to young girls?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Data Science is the field of drawing actionable insights from data. In plain English, it means that you get historical data, you find underlying patterns in it. For an instance, ice-cream sales go up when temperature rises. This leads to you recommending your boss that we should sell more ice-cream in summers. This way sales increase, boss is happy, you get promoted, and it’s a win-win!</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><em><strong>4. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I chose this field as it combines two things I like &#8211; math and coding. But more importantly, it allows me to reach the ultimate goal of better decision making. Growing up, a lot of my decision-making was based on random choices and lots (lots! lots!) of elderly advice. Being in this field forces me to take better evidence/data-backed decisions myself.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><em><strong>5. What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Data Science is filled with mind-boggling things that people work on. To name a few –</p>



<ul><li>predicting future: which customer will leave the company; which patient will go on to develop a disease. And my personal favorite – predicting who will commit bank fraud!</li><li>recommendations: Amazon, Etsy, Spotify, any and everyone who recommends stuff to customers uses data science to understand user preferences,</li><li>extracting handwritten text from scanned documents,</li><li>recognizing cats vs dogs in pictures,</li><li>chatbots, and many more.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><em><strong>6. What keeps you going in your profession?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Two things: (1) the power of discovering answers from data and (2) there is so much more to learn and so little that I know.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><em><strong>7. What goals do you have in your career?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I want to gain depths of knowledge and experience to be able to drive decisions for high-impact business problems and create positive change. Eventually, I want to apply my skillset towards social good such as solutioning for climate change, agricultural productivity and plastic waste reduction.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><em><strong>8. What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in STEM?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I have had a very few women role models in STEM, whose stories of pushing through struggles and shattering the glass ceiling would be something I could look up to. I have also had fewer opportunities (than I would like) of working with compassionate and ambitious women in managerial/senior leadership roles. The reason I think having a supportive network of women is important because they can empathize better on certain experiences you witness in the career like for example, managing emotional intelligence while working as a part of a team. &nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><em><strong>9. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">STEM lays the core foundation for innovation, and innovation is the only constant. So grab a seat at the table where decisions are made, be at the forefront of change and make use of the powerful tools that STEM has to offer to solve complex and rewarding problems.</p>

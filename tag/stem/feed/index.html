<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hello, my name is Laura and I am a Marine Biology student at University of Portsmouth. I completed my foundation degree (FdSc) in Marine Ecology and Conservation at University Centre Sparsholt in Winchester this past June. I have recently moved down to Portsmouth to do a top up year which will give me a full honors BSc degree in Marine Biology. I have always loved being by the coast, whether it be rock pooling, bodyboarding, going on boat trips or simply swimming. I soon realized that studying the ocean would be my dream, however I never thought I would have the grades or intelligence to do it. However, by doing a foundation degree I was able to find a way into my dream field where I originally thought I would never have the chance.</p>

<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>1. How would you describe your role?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Currently I am a University student, so I am still studying for my bachelor’s degree. As I am in my final year, I am working on my final year project which involves doing independent research on a chosen subject and writing a scientific paper about the subject discussing what you have found. The research that I will be looking at focuses on dolphin identification and analyzing dolphins dorsal fin scars to explore not only the origins of the scars but if there are patterns in which they occur. The sorts of patterns I will be looking into may include “Do dolphins get more scars at certain times of the year?”, “Do male dolphins have more scars than female dolphins?” and “Are younger dolphins more likely to get scars than older dolphins?”. Although I am yet to start my research, I have a good understanding of these focuses and can’t wait to see what I find out.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>2. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I actually didn’t know what STEM was until I started university. Since discovering what STEM was, I realized that women are very underrepresented and there are far too many people out there that think that women can’t/are unable to have a job in STEM discipline.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I do have some massive inspirations that helped me realize that Marine Biology was something that I wanted to pursue. Dr. Sylvia Earle is my biggest inspiration and a woman I would love to meet. Sylvia is a Marine Biologist and oceanographer who is now 85 and has spent her life researching the oceans and raising awareness for the need of conservation. She has a charity called Mission Blue (which is also the name of her Netflix documentary which I thoroughly recommend everyone to watch) which helps to create ‘Hope spots’ of marine protected areas. She has also done many talks around the world, including one for TED which is about 10 minutes long and a must watch.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>3. What’s the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In terms of school to be able to study marine biology at university you want to make sure you have focused your studies at school to some of the sciences. Biology, Geography and Maths are pretty useful to have; however, they are not always necessary depending on where you want to study but will give you a good head start.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Its always good to try and get volunteer work either before or whilst you’re studying for your degree. If you live near the coast you may be able to organize local beach clean ups, this will show that you are driven and organized. There may also be local rescue centers for animals such as seals who may take volunteers. Otherwise any sort of aquarium, pet shop, conservation or wildlife organization will be beneficial.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>4. What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are so many amazing things going on in Marine Biology at the moment. There are companies that are growing and replanting corals to help restore coral reefs that have been affected by climate change. There are companies who are tagging marine animals such as sharks and turtles in order to be able to track and research their patterns in terms of migration, feeding and reproduction. Restoring seagrass beds, dealing with oil spills, research in laboratories in microbiology, diving research and much more.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>5. What keeps you going in your research? What’s next for your career?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am hoping to go on to do a masters in either Marine Biology, Marine Ecology and Conservation or Marine Mammal science once I have completed my BSc. After this I hope to be able to travel the world and do research and raise awareness for conservation of the oceans.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>6. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I honestly think social networking can be a real help. Since starting my marine biology Instagram account, I have met so many amazing women in STEM and in my field specifically. It can be so useful to know other people in the field. Everyone has their own areas and each friend you make will be able to give you tips and tricks on certain things whether it be diving centers/sites in a certain country, sustainability and eco friendly tips, best universities for masters degrees, best places to find volunteer work and books/journals/papers to read. Once you have a community of other women in STEM you feel unstoppable and supported and motivated to keep pushing and inspiring more women to join STEM disciplines.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>7. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Don’t let other people put down your dreams. If you want something enough and you work hard enough you will be able to do anything. It is your life and you are the one that has to live it so you can’t let people tell you what you can and can’t do.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Have you ever been micromanaged by someone? Turns out more than half of the working population experiences micromanagement. So there is a possibility that you have experienced it too. Certainly, this is something neither the employees nor the employer is proud of. Often micromanagement kills productivity since no one likes someone breathing down their neck all the time. Micromanagement often brings the efficiency down and creates an unhealthy work environment for the employees. But what causes micromanagement? Doubts about employee’s competency, urge to be in control all the time, overly detail-oriented and much more which we will discuss shortly.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-yellow-background-color has-background has-large-font-size">SIGNS YOU ARE BEING MICROMANAGED</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />You are being asked to provide frequent updates.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Even the simplest decision is questioned by the manager.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />You feel being controlled most of the times.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />You are losing confidence.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />You are always worrying about how the manager will react.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-yellow-background-color has-background has-large-font-size">IF YOU ARE BEING MICROMANAGED, DO THIS:</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Gain the micromanager’s trust- Prove that you are capable of handling things on your own.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Document everything you do- I learned this from my mentor and it has personally helped me.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Meet deadlines.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Keep the micromanager in loop in case of any changes. It is important to anticipate a situation and provide updates upfront at least in the beginning to help them with the whole trust process.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Ask for feedback from the manager about your performance.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Communicate how you feel- Usually micromanagers are not aware that they are micromanaging. People try to improve efficiency but end up becoming controlling. There is a thin line between being detail-oriented and obsessive, and unfortunately employees are the ones realizing it first. Let the manager know how this is in fact affecting your efficiency and mental health in your next 1:1.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-yellow-background-color has-background has-large-font-size">IF YOU ARE A MICROMANAGER, DO THIS:</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Learn to trust- Each employee has a different way of working. If a person doesn’t work the way you do, it doesn’t mean they are incompetent.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Focus on the end result- Instead of interrupting the process, give your employees a chance to perform tasks according to them. If the end result doesn’t satisfy you, you can suggest a different approach. But give people a chance.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Let go- We all have and will make mistakes at work, and in fact it is one of the best ways to learn. While judging an employee take both achievements and mistakes into consideration instead of just focusing on the mistakes. Try not to label employees as incompetent just on the basis of a few mistakes.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Communicate your basic expectations from the employees and ask them to work towards meeting them.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Ask for feedback from the employees on your leadership.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Try to revisit your non-managerial days.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Sometimes the reason people micromanage is because they have been micromanaged by their managers. We learn from our experiences and if this is the only experience your manager have had then it is going to be difficult for them to not replicate it. Be patient and help your manager realize what they are doing is not serving the purpose.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size">My name is Nicole Young and I am a developer and freelancer based in Pennsylvania, USA.&nbsp; I got into tech after I graduated from college with a degree in Psychology. I was planning on accepting an offer for a PhD but instead was given the opportunity to go to Malaysia for a year for an academic grant to teach English. When I returned, I wanted to continue to pursue opportunities where I could be more hands on and found a job at a tech startup. I learned so much in the two year that I was there and was introduced to coding and resources that inevitably helped me to teach myself development and start freelancing.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>1.What is your specific area of STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am a technologist. Not only am I a developer but I also pay attention to the trends, patterns and practices of the industry. I think that it is important to do that no matter the field.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>2.How would you explain your STEM field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I use my skills to help people build an online presence so that they can reach the people that they want to help. I build websites and provide other services to help people make a good impression online.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>3.What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I was inspired by the work that I was doing in my first job and inspired by all of the new things that I was learning. I chose Tech because it felt right to me. It was where I felt like I could make the largest impact.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>4.What’s the best way to enter your field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">No matter what age you are right now there are ways that you can start getting in to tech and coding right now! There are lots of games and websites geared toward helping young people understand how to code and build the problem solving skills that they need to be successful at it.&nbsp; Take some time to explore the websites and social media platforms that you are on everyday and learn a bit about how they are made. It will definitely amaze you!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>5.What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Anything that you can access on the web right now was built by someone with a development or engineering skill set, Developers like me work each day to create the cool websites, software, games and social media platforms that we all know and love!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>6.What keeps you going in your profession?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Keep a steady habit of learning is important and keeps me going. Also staying curious and wanting to push myself to create new and awesome things keeps me interested in what I do.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>7.What are your future career goals?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I would like to start my own organization where I help other women and people of color learn new tech skills for free where they can be placed in jobs that will give them new opportunities to learn a high paying skill.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>8.What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in stem?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It can feel lonely at times. I am often the only woman of color in the spaces that I am in and it can feel isolating and discouraging. There is also things like imposter syndrome (not feeling like I belong or am qualified enough to do what I do) and the feeling that I have to prove myself to those around me more than everyone else does.&nbsp; Those all can take a toll on you mentally and emotionally, which can make it tough to move forward sometimes.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>9.What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Stay curious and focused on your goals. Experiment and never be afraid to try new things.&nbsp; I think there is a lot of pressure on young people to have their lives figured out before they entered the real world and I want whoever is reading to know &#8211; that’s not true! It will take time but keep chasing the things that fill you with joy and fire because those things will lead you to what is best for you!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hello! I&#8217;m Daisy and I&#8217;m an experimental quantum physics PhD candidate at the University of Surrey&#8217;s Advanced&nbsp;Technology Institute.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I&#8217;ve been interested in science for as long as I can remember, although I also have a passion for art and  was torn between pursuing art or science as a career. I eventually settled on science and opted to keep my creative pursuits as hobbies. What I&#8217;ve come to realise is that to be a scientist and a researcher you need to be creative so that side of me comes in handy when I&#8217;m solving problems and designing new experiments. Once I&#8217;d decided to do science I then had to decide which one! I knew I had more interest in the physical sciences and as physics was my favourite&nbsp;subject from when I was 16, I opted to do a physics degree.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">During the later years of high school, I had a lot of trouble with socialising and developed&nbsp;major depressive disorder and generalised anxiety disorder. It wasn&#8217;t until near the end of my degree that I was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and my challenges since high school began to make sense. I now have autism-specific support at my university and speak openly about the challenges and strengths of being autistic. During my degree, I had the opportunity to do a year of research for my master&#8217;s project so I applied to be a research and development intern at the Centre for Integrated Photonics where I worked on designing and testing semiconductor lasers for telecommunications applications. After graduating from my MPhys, I applied to do PhDs in quantum technologies and I started my PhD in 2018 working on a project on &#8216;development of InSb quantum point contacts for quantum technology applications&#8217;. I absolutely love my research and regularly talk about it as well as my experience as an autistic person in STEM and academia on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/notesfromthephysicslab/"><em>social media</em></a> and my <a href="https://www.notesfromthephysicslab.com/links"><em>blog</em></a>.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em><strong>1.What is your specific area of STEM?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My current sub-field is semiconductor spintronics. This falls under the larger field of quantum technologies. These fields are quite interdisciplinary with physicists, materials scientists, engineers and chemists all working within it. I approach my work from the perspective of experimental quantum physics, so I get to delve into the fundamental quantum physics phenomenon as well as looking at the fabrication and engineering side of things.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em><strong>2.How would you explain your STEM field?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Semiconductor spintronics is a field which looks at exploiting electron spin in semiconductor materials for quantum technology applications. Let me break down all that jargon a bit: Semiconductors are a group of materials which can sometimes behave like a conductor and sometimes like an insulator. They have highly &#8216;tunable&#8217; properties and are the materials used in most technology these days. All of the transistors and other components in your phone and computer are made from predominantly semiconductor materials. They also make up a lot of the telecommunications infrastructure as semiconductors can be used to make lasers and other optical devices such as LEDs. Spintronics is short for &#8216;spin transport electronics&#8217; and it essentially is an extension of electronics. In electronics, we use the charge of electrons in materials to make technology and spintronics extends that to include an additional degree of freedom: spin. One of the most interesting applications of spintronics is in quantum computing where it is a key concept for solid-state electron spin qubits. My current research looks at ways to produce a current of electrons with a particular spin state using nanostructures made from semiconductor quantum wells which can be used to initialize&nbsp;spin-based qubits.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>3.What are some challenges you face in this field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It&#8217;s a very new field so there are still lots of things we don&#8217;t know. But in a way, this is what makes it exciting! More generally, I have some challenges with my communication and processing differences due to being autistic but I&#8217;m developing great self-advocacy skills to enable me to work to the best of my ability (and this isn&#8217;t really a field-specific challenge, just more of a general life challenge).</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>4.What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My decision to get into quantum physics comes from a class in high school. In chemistry, we were learning about electron shells in atoms and the concept of electron spin was mentioned. I instantly became fascinated with what this meant and asked my teacher who told me to ask a physics teacher. I did and since then had a fascination with quantum physics and the concept of spin. In fact, applied quantum physics is one of my longest-standing autistic &#8216;special interests&#8217; which is why I am so drawn to it as a career. I&#8217;ve also been very inspired by the incredible Emmy Noether since high school and find her to be such a role model for trailblazing women in physics and mathematics.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>5.What’s the best way to enter your field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I don&#8217;t think there is one particular &#8216;best&#8217; route for anything really. If you want to be a quantum physicist I do think you need a good grounding in physics&#8211; whether that is a degree or an apprenticeship (for example, the National Physical Laboratory offers science apprenticeships).&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>6.What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There&#8217;s always so much amazing research coming out of quantum technology! Probably the most notable is the recent work from Google reaching &#8216;quantum supremacy&#8217;. Although there is a lot of hype around it, we still have a long way to go (decades probably) until we see anything resembling a functioning, commercially viable quantum computer.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>7.What keeps you going in your profession?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Knowing that I am part of the research effort towards new technologies which help advance progress in a whole host of disciplines.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>8.What are your future career goals?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I would like to be working in quantum technology R&amp;D, whether that is in academia or industry. I&#8217;d also like to develop my science communication freelance work so that I can help educate people on physics online as well as raise awareness about topics I&#8217;m passionate about such as making STEM more accessible to disabled people.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>9.What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I stick out within my research group due to my gender. I hope that in the future this isn&#8217;t the case but not many women progress to senior positions in physics and I&#8217;m very aware of that. Sometimes there are comments about my gender which strike me as odd because surely the most important thing about my academic work is the quality of my research, not my gender!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>10.What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you have a passion for STEM then go for it. Contrary to stereotypes, you don&#8217;t need to be anything apart from curious, determined and have a thirst for knowledge to work in STEM fields!</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hi! My name is Shreya and I’m a full time backend software developer based in San Diego, California. I’m an active member of the Lean In Women In Tech community here and can be found speaking at the occasional tech event as an advocate for minorities in tech. Prior to this, I’ve worked at various corporations around the Silicon Valley in California. I hold a degree in bioinformatics from the University of California San Diego.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">1.<em><strong>What</strong></em> <strong><em>is your specific area of STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I work as a software engineer within the tech industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">2.<strong><em>What is the best way to enter your field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">One of the great things about software engineering is that there’s never just one way to do things! This includes breaking in. The most traditional option is to get a 4 year undergraduate degree in computer science and apply for software engineering internships along the way, culminating in a full time job as a software developer after college. But this definitely isn’t the only way! There are coding boot camps worth looking in to that teach the skills necessary to become a full-fledged software developer in just a few months. Yet another option is to use an online course platform such as Udemy to self-tech yourself programming and begin freelancing from there!&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">3.<strong><em>What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Software engineers work on every application on your phone! They work on your automated kitchen appliances and your home security system. Even when you’re going to get a drink at Starbucks, you’ve used applications spanning thousands of lines of code! From using your Maps app to get to the store to the application the cashier uses to punch in your order, you’re often using software everywhere without even realizing it!&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">4.<strong><em>What keeps you going in your profession?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Something that I love at my job is that every day is different. Every day I get to solve a new problem that no-one else has worked on before! The more complex the task, the greater feeling of accomplishment at the end of the day.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">5.<strong><em>What are your future career goals?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As an advocate of minorities in tech, my goal within the tech community is to normalize and start discussions about difficult situations within the workplace. I try to empower others by providing potential solutions to these problems and provide a platform for others to build off of each other and connect.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In general I divide my goal focuses by category: career, personal skills, financial, and health. My overarching theme for 2020 has been exploration. I’m trying to delve into new ideas with a more open mind.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My career goals involve broadening my skillset technically as well as non-technically, translating to moving up the engineering ladder.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">6.<strong><em>What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in stem?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It’s no secret that the odds are stacked up against women in STEM trying to build a successful career. One of the biggest challenges adding on to that is imposter syndrome. The way I define imposter syndrome is when one constantly and repeatedly doubts the legitimacy of their accomplishments and is worried that they don’t deserve to belong or succeed. I face this in waves, usually when in periods of great growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">7.<strong><em>What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">If I can suggest two virtues to develop, they would be clear communication and persistence — these have changed the game for my career and personal life. Just know that if you set your mind to it, you CAN and WILL succeed.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hi! My name is Mariana and I was born in Colombia. After my family and I survived one of the worst earthquakes in the Colombian history, we moved to Spain to start a new life. We faced struggles settling down but somehow managed to find a place to live and a spot for me in public school. One day, my mother showed me a news article about Dr Anna Veiga, the first scientist in Spain who succeeded in in-vitro fertilization, this urged me to become like her. I was 17 when I realized I wanted to be a medic and gave my best to become one. Unfortunately, I faced anxiety and panic attacks throughout my exams and contests that I participated for getting into medicine. One day, my mother showed me another news article: “ Bioinformatics, the Medicine of the Future”, this inspired me to my core. I recently graduated with a degree in Bioinformatics and currently studying MPhil in Medical Science at the University of Cambridge.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">1. <em>What is your specific area of STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Bioinformatics. It is the art of using computational resources in any scientific field (maths, physics, chemistry, biology and so on). For me, I chose to focus on Medical Sciences and stem cells &#8211; I am currently working at the Haematology department at the University of Cambridge, so the cells I am focused on are blood stem cells.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">2. <em>What goals do you have for the future?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My short-term goals are to pursue a PhD at the University of Cambridge and to grow as a science communicator on social media to help others to fight for their dreams, especially in stem fields.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">3. <em>What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Our lab is divided between experimentalists and bioinformaticians, and we all work on Haematopoiesis (the study of blood cell types formation). The bioinformaticians work from mathematical models to machine learning and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis. In my case, I’m in the last group: I’m working on developing a computational pipeline for single-cell multimodal analysis (samples obtained using NGS)</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">4. <em>What keeps you going in your field?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I have loved studying stem cells since I was 17! Now I have the chance of using my “futuristic” bioinformatics skills in this field. It’s incredible to know I can keep learning everyday, don&#8217;t you think?</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">5. <em>What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in stem?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Though it is getting better, I still find it very difficult to see gender equality. There still are lack of women in STEM. I remember my first day at the Faculty of Informatics, there was a group of men sitting in the cafe and they whispered, “look, I bet she got lost” &#8211; they were talking about me! The worst mistake is to assume a woman is not capable of pursuing or being interested in STEM fields.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">6. <em>What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I would suggest them not listening to everything that people say. I have been psychologically attacked by narrow-minded people who kept saying that I should remember where I came from and stop dreaming about studying overseas. People have said that I cannot afford higher education in a foreign country, that I cannot get into medicine, and that maybe I should stop thinking about STEM fields. People have said that I am too young to leave home because it seems scary, I have heard them complain of me spending too much time studying instead of having fun (but they have no idea how fun I find my job!). I have experienced this so I can tell you that it’s your time to prove yourself and the world how STRONG you can be. Don’t stop, KEEP DREAMING.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hi, I am Urja and I am in the final year of dentistry. Choosing a field in medicine was the easiest decision of my life. I am a doctor and I enjoy helping people. Other than that, I am an ambivert and I love to party! I have a degree in Bharatnatyam, I was an athlete in school and still enjoy sports, and I am always up for learning new things. Thanks to quarantine, I learned to do digital art!</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>1.<em>How would you explain your stem field to young girls?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We are the teeth doctors! We specialise in oral health and diagnose oral diseases. We create treatment plans for patients and help maintain or restore their oral health, we also take x-rays, monitor growth and development of teeth/jaws, and perform surgeries if necessary. In short, we help you keep your mouth happy.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>2</strong>.<strong> <em>Why did you choose your STEM field? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My dad’s an Orthopaedic surgeon, watching him treat people and earn respect had an effect on me. Well, it was either that or MR’s gifts (just kidding). I decided to study MBBS but getting admission for medical is definitely not a piece of cake. Unfortunately, while I was preparing for my entrance, government changed rules and the admission process was going to be based solely on NEET. This was really important to me but at the same time I was running short on prep time. The pressure was real and unfortunately I got hit by anxiety. Long story short, I pushed through and got myself a nice seat for dentistry and I am enjoying this field ever since.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>3. </strong><em><strong>What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">What is usually the first thing you notice in a person? Smile. So I guess one of the coolest things that people in my profession do is smile designing. We also treat defects or disabilities that people are born with or get due to some disease. We assist in something known as “habit breaking”- believe me, it is exactly what it sounds like. We help patients break habits like thumb sucking, tongue thrusting and so on. And as a dentist, I am really proud of this last one- we promote anti-tabocco campaigns.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>4. </strong><em><strong>What keeps you going in your profession?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I strongly believe that one of the worst pains in human body is tooth ache, so it makes me happy to offer my help for relieving that pain. It warms my heart when I see a smile back on my patient’s faces. My work gives me tremendous satisfaction and my happy patients is what keeps me going.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>5. </strong><em><strong>What goals do you have for the future?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">A lot of people even in the developed countries ignore dental health. I would really like to spread awareness about importance of dental hygiene and help avoid the risk of diseases like oral cancer.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>6. <em>What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Smile changes how a person is pursued. It plays a vital role in developing one’s personality and yet people underestimate the power of oral health. But guess what, we are here for them. As a dentist you can help people look good and spread awareness about dental hygiene. Help us spread smiles <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hello, my name is Laura and I am a Marine Biology student at University of Portsmouth. I completed my foundation degree (FdSc) in Marine Ecology and Conservation at University Centre Sparsholt in Winchester this past June. I have recently moved down to Portsmouth to do a top up year which will give me a full honors BSc degree in Marine Biology. I have always loved being by the coast, whether it be rock pooling, bodyboarding, going on boat trips or simply swimming. I soon realized that studying the ocean would be my dream, however I never thought I would have the grades or intelligence to do it. However, by doing a foundation degree I was able to find a way into my dream field where I originally thought I would never have the chance.</p>

<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>1. How would you describe your role?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Currently I am a University student, so I am still studying for my bachelor’s degree. As I am in my final year, I am working on my final year project which involves doing independent research on a chosen subject and writing a scientific paper about the subject discussing what you have found. The research that I will be looking at focuses on dolphin identification and analyzing dolphins dorsal fin scars to explore not only the origins of the scars but if there are patterns in which they occur. The sorts of patterns I will be looking into may include “Do dolphins get more scars at certain times of the year?”, “Do male dolphins have more scars than female dolphins?” and “Are younger dolphins more likely to get scars than older dolphins?”. Although I am yet to start my research, I have a good understanding of these focuses and can’t wait to see what I find out.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>2. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I actually didn’t know what STEM was until I started university. Since discovering what STEM was, I realized that women are very underrepresented and there are far too many people out there that think that women can’t/are unable to have a job in STEM discipline.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I do have some massive inspirations that helped me realize that Marine Biology was something that I wanted to pursue. Dr. Sylvia Earle is my biggest inspiration and a woman I would love to meet. Sylvia is a Marine Biologist and oceanographer who is now 85 and has spent her life researching the oceans and raising awareness for the need of conservation. She has a charity called Mission Blue (which is also the name of her Netflix documentary which I thoroughly recommend everyone to watch) which helps to create ‘Hope spots’ of marine protected areas. She has also done many talks around the world, including one for TED which is about 10 minutes long and a must watch.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>3. What’s the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In terms of school to be able to study marine biology at university you want to make sure you have focused your studies at school to some of the sciences. Biology, Geography and Maths are pretty useful to have; however, they are not always necessary depending on where you want to study but will give you a good head start.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Its always good to try and get volunteer work either before or whilst you’re studying for your degree. If you live near the coast you may be able to organize local beach clean ups, this will show that you are driven and organized. There may also be local rescue centers for animals such as seals who may take volunteers. Otherwise any sort of aquarium, pet shop, conservation or wildlife organization will be beneficial.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>4. What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are so many amazing things going on in Marine Biology at the moment. There are companies that are growing and replanting corals to help restore coral reefs that have been affected by climate change. There are companies who are tagging marine animals such as sharks and turtles in order to be able to track and research their patterns in terms of migration, feeding and reproduction. Restoring seagrass beds, dealing with oil spills, research in laboratories in microbiology, diving research and much more.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>5. What keeps you going in your research? What’s next for your career?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am hoping to go on to do a masters in either Marine Biology, Marine Ecology and Conservation or Marine Mammal science once I have completed my BSc. After this I hope to be able to travel the world and do research and raise awareness for conservation of the oceans.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>6. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I honestly think social networking can be a real help. Since starting my marine biology Instagram account, I have met so many amazing women in STEM and in my field specifically. It can be so useful to know other people in the field. Everyone has their own areas and each friend you make will be able to give you tips and tricks on certain things whether it be diving centers/sites in a certain country, sustainability and eco friendly tips, best universities for masters degrees, best places to find volunteer work and books/journals/papers to read. Once you have a community of other women in STEM you feel unstoppable and supported and motivated to keep pushing and inspiring more women to join STEM disciplines.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>7. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Don’t let other people put down your dreams. If you want something enough and you work hard enough you will be able to do anything. It is your life and you are the one that has to live it so you can’t let people tell you what you can and can’t do.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hi! My name is Shreya and I’m a full time backend software developer based in San Diego, California. I’m an active member of the Lean In Women In Tech community here and can be found speaking at the occasional tech event as an advocate for minorities in tech. Prior to this, I’ve worked at various corporations around the Silicon Valley in California. I hold a degree in bioinformatics from the University of California San Diego.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">1.<em><strong>What</strong></em> <strong><em>is your specific area of STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I work as a software engineer within the tech industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">2.<strong><em>What is the best way to enter your field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">One of the great things about software engineering is that there’s never just one way to do things! This includes breaking in. The most traditional option is to get a 4 year undergraduate degree in computer science and apply for software engineering internships along the way, culminating in a full time job as a software developer after college. But this definitely isn’t the only way! There are coding boot camps worth looking in to that teach the skills necessary to become a full-fledged software developer in just a few months. Yet another option is to use an online course platform such as Udemy to self-tech yourself programming and begin freelancing from there!&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">3.<strong><em>What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Software engineers work on every application on your phone! They work on your automated kitchen appliances and your home security system. Even when you’re going to get a drink at Starbucks, you’ve used applications spanning thousands of lines of code! From using your Maps app to get to the store to the application the cashier uses to punch in your order, you’re often using software everywhere without even realizing it!&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">4.<strong><em>What keeps you going in your profession?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Something that I love at my job is that every day is different. Every day I get to solve a new problem that no-one else has worked on before! The more complex the task, the greater feeling of accomplishment at the end of the day.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">5.<strong><em>What are your future career goals?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As an advocate of minorities in tech, my goal within the tech community is to normalize and start discussions about difficult situations within the workplace. I try to empower others by providing potential solutions to these problems and provide a platform for others to build off of each other and connect.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In general I divide my goal focuses by category: career, personal skills, financial, and health. My overarching theme for 2020 has been exploration. I’m trying to delve into new ideas with a more open mind.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My career goals involve broadening my skillset technically as well as non-technically, translating to moving up the engineering ladder.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">6.<strong><em>What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in stem?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It’s no secret that the odds are stacked up against women in STEM trying to build a successful career. One of the biggest challenges adding on to that is imposter syndrome. The way I define imposter syndrome is when one constantly and repeatedly doubts the legitimacy of their accomplishments and is worried that they don’t deserve to belong or succeed. I face this in waves, usually when in periods of great growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">7.<strong><em>What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">If I can suggest two virtues to develop, they would be clear communication and persistence — these have changed the game for my career and personal life. Just know that if you set your mind to it, you CAN and WILL succeed.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hi! My name is Mariana and I was born in Colombia. After my family and I survived one of the worst earthquakes in the Colombian history, we moved to Spain to start a new life. We faced struggles settling down but somehow managed to find a place to live and a spot for me in public school. One day, my mother showed me a news article about Dr Anna Veiga, the first scientist in Spain who succeeded in in-vitro fertilization, this urged me to become like her. I was 17 when I realized I wanted to be a medic and gave my best to become one. Unfortunately, I faced anxiety and panic attacks throughout my exams and contests that I participated for getting into medicine. One day, my mother showed me another news article: “ Bioinformatics, the Medicine of the Future”, this inspired me to my core. I recently graduated with a degree in Bioinformatics and currently studying MPhil in Medical Science at the University of Cambridge.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">1. <em>What is your specific area of STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Bioinformatics. It is the art of using computational resources in any scientific field (maths, physics, chemistry, biology and so on). For me, I chose to focus on Medical Sciences and stem cells &#8211; I am currently working at the Haematology department at the University of Cambridge, so the cells I am focused on are blood stem cells.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">2. <em>What goals do you have for the future?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My short-term goals are to pursue a PhD at the University of Cambridge and to grow as a science communicator on social media to help others to fight for their dreams, especially in stem fields.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">3. <em>What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Our lab is divided between experimentalists and bioinformaticians, and we all work on Haematopoiesis (the study of blood cell types formation). The bioinformaticians work from mathematical models to machine learning and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis. In my case, I’m in the last group: I’m working on developing a computational pipeline for single-cell multimodal analysis (samples obtained using NGS)</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">4. <em>What keeps you going in your field?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I have loved studying stem cells since I was 17! Now I have the chance of using my “futuristic” bioinformatics skills in this field. It’s incredible to know I can keep learning everyday, don&#8217;t you think?</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">5. <em>What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in stem?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Though it is getting better, I still find it very difficult to see gender equality. There still are lack of women in STEM. I remember my first day at the Faculty of Informatics, there was a group of men sitting in the cafe and they whispered, “look, I bet she got lost” &#8211; they were talking about me! The worst mistake is to assume a woman is not capable of pursuing or being interested in STEM fields.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">6. <em>What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I would suggest them not listening to everything that people say. I have been psychologically attacked by narrow-minded people who kept saying that I should remember where I came from and stop dreaming about studying overseas. People have said that I cannot afford higher education in a foreign country, that I cannot get into medicine, and that maybe I should stop thinking about STEM fields. People have said that I am too young to leave home because it seems scary, I have heard them complain of me spending too much time studying instead of having fun (but they have no idea how fun I find my job!). I have experienced this so I can tell you that it’s your time to prove yourself and the world how STRONG you can be. Don’t stop, KEEP DREAMING.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">My name is Sukanya, and I am a data scientist! I have a Master&#8217;s degree in Business Analytics and I love reading (check out – ‘Why We Sleep’ and thank me later <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />), calligraphy, and researching about data science. Being a minority, I am always looking for ways to encourage more women in STEM. I also have been a part of Women In Data Science conferences, so here&#8217;s another attempt to do the same.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>1.What&#8217;s your story?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I started my career as a software engineer but craved on solving more challenging problems employing cutting-edge technologies. And just then I stumbled upon Masters in Analytics program which was a step ahead of coding. It had an enticing combination of math (one of my early childhood fascinations) and coding for uncovering useful information hidden in data. I jumped at the opportunity and so far this field has never ceased to fascinate me with it&#8217;s advancements.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em><strong>2. What is your specific area of STEM?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My focus is Data Science. It is a subset of Artificial Intelligence and includes statistics, probability, coding (Python is the most in-demand, R comes next), and machine learning.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em><strong>3. How would you explain your STEM field to young girls?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Data Science is the field of drawing actionable insights from data. In plain English, it means that you get historical data, you find underlying patterns in it. For an instance, ice-cream sales go up when temperature rises. This leads to you recommending your boss that we should sell more ice-cream in summers. This way sales increase, boss is happy, you get promoted, and it’s a win-win!</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em><strong>4. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I chose this field as it combines two things I like &#8211; math and coding. But more importantly, it allows me to reach the ultimate goal of better decision making. Growing up, a lot of my decision-making was based on random choices and lots (lots! lots!) of elderly advice. Being in this field forces me to take better evidence/data-backed decisions myself.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em><strong>5. What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Data Science is filled with mind-boggling things that people work on. To name a few –</p>



<ul><li>predicting future: which customer will leave the company; which patient will go on to develop a disease. And my personal favorite – predicting who will commit bank fraud!</li><li>recommendations: Amazon, Etsy, Spotify, any and everyone who recommends stuff to customers uses data science to understand user preferences,</li><li>extracting handwritten text from scanned documents,</li><li>recognizing cats vs dogs in pictures,</li><li>chatbots, and many more.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em><strong>6. What keeps you going in your profession?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Two things: (1) the power of discovering answers from data and (2) there is so much more to learn and so little that I know.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em><strong>7. What goals do you have in your career?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I want to gain depths of knowledge and experience to be able to drive decisions for high-impact business problems and create positive change. Eventually, I want to apply my skillset towards social good such as solutioning for climate change, agricultural productivity and plastic waste reduction.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em><strong>8. What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in STEM?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I have had a very few women role models in STEM, whose stories of pushing through struggles and shattering the glass ceiling would be something I could look up to. I have also had fewer opportunities (than I would like) of working with compassionate and ambitious women in managerial/senior leadership roles. The reason I think having a supportive network of women is important because they can empathize better on certain experiences you witness in the career like for example, managing emotional intelligence while working as a part of a team. &nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em><strong>9. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">STEM lays the core foundation for innovation, and innovation is the only constant. So grab a seat at the table where decisions are made, be at the forefront of change and make use of the powerful tools that STEM has to offer to solve complex and rewarding problems.</p>

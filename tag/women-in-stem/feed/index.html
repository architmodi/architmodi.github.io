<p class="has-normal-font-size">Hi! My name is Mariana and I was born in Colombia. After my family and I survived one of the worst earthquakes in the Colombian history, we moved to Spain to start a new life. We faced struggles settling down but somehow managed to find a place to live and a spot for me in public school. One day, my mother showed me a news article about Dr Anna Veiga, the first scientist in Spain who succeeded in in-vitro fertilization, this urged me to become like her. I was 17 when I realized I wanted to be a medic and gave my best to become one. Unfortunately, I faced anxiety and panic attacks throughout my exams and contests that I participated for getting into medicine. One day, my mother showed me another news article: ‚Äú Bioinformatics, the Medicine of the Future‚Äù, this inspired me to my core. I recently graduated with a degree in Bioinformatics and currently studying MPhil in Medical Science at the University of Cambridge.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">1. <em>What is your specific area of STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Bioinformatics. It is the art of using computational resources in any scientific field (maths, physics, chemistry, biology and so on). For me, I chose to focus on Medical Sciences and stem cells &#8211; I am currently working at the Haematology department at the University of Cambridge, so the cells I am focused on are blood stem cells.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">2. <em>What goals do you have for the future?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">My short-term goals are to pursue a PhD at the University of Cambridge and to grow as a science communicator on social media to help others to fight for their dreams, especially in stem fields.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">3. <em>What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Our lab is divided between experimentalists and bioinformaticians, and we all work on Haematopoiesis (the study of blood cell types formation). The bioinformaticians work from mathematical models to machine learning and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis. In my case, I‚Äôm in the last group: I‚Äôm working on developing a computational pipeline for single-cell multimodal analysis (samples obtained using NGS)</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">4. <em>What keeps you going in your field?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I have loved studying stem cells since I was 17! Now I have the chance of using my ‚Äúfuturistic‚Äù bioinformatics skills in this field. It‚Äôs incredible to know I can keep learning everyday, don&#8217;t you think?</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">5. <em>What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in stem?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Though it is getting better, I still find it very difficult to see gender equality. There still are lack of women in STEM. I remember my first day at the Faculty of Informatics, there was a group of men sitting in the cafe and they whispered, ‚Äúlook, I bet she got lost‚Äù &#8211; they were talking about me! The worst mistake is to assume a woman is not capable of pursuing or being interested in STEM fields.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">6. <em>What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">I would suggest them not listening to everything that people say. I have been psychologically attacked by narrow-minded people who kept saying that I should remember where I came from and stop dreaming about studying overseas. People have said that I cannot afford higher education in a foreign country, that I cannot get into medicine, and that maybe I should stop thinking about STEM fields. People have said that I am too young to leave home because it seems scary, I have heard them complain of me spending too much time studying instead of having fun (but they have no idea how fun I find my job!). I have experienced this so I can tell you that it‚Äôs your time to prove yourself and the world how STRONG you can be. Don‚Äôt stop, KEEP DREAMING.</p>

<p>My name is Sukanya, and I am a data scientist! I have a Master&#8217;s degree in Business Analytics and I love reading (check out ‚Äì ‚ÄòWhy We Sleep‚Äô and thank me later <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />), calligraphy, and researching about data science. Being a minority, I am always looking for ways to encourage more women in STEM. I also have been a part of Women In Data Science conferences, so here&#8217;s another attempt to do the same.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<ol><li><em>What&#8217;s your story?</em></li></ol>



<p>I started my career as a software engineer but craved on solving more challenging problems employing cutting-edge technologies. And just then I stumbled upon Masters in Analytics program which was a step ahead of coding. It had an enticing combination of math (one of my early childhood fascinations) and coding for uncovering useful information hidden in data. I jumped at the opportunity and so far this field has never ceased to fascinate me with it&#8217;s advancements.</p>



<p></p>



<p><em>2. What is your specific area of STEM?</em></p>



<p>My focus is Data Science. It is a subset of Artificial Intelligence and includes statistics, probability, coding (Python is the most in-demand, R comes next), and machine learning.</p>



<p></p>



<p><em>3. How would you explain your STEM field to young girls?</em></p>



<p>Data Science is the field of drawing actionable insights from data. In plain English, it means that you get historical data, you find underlying patterns in it. For an instance, ice-cream sales go up when temperature rises. This leads to you recommending your boss that we should sell more ice-cream in summers. This way sales increase, boss is happy, you get promoted, and it‚Äôs a win-win!</p>



<p></p>



<p><em>4. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p>I chose this field as it combines two things I like &#8211; math and coding. But more importantly, it allows me to reach the ultimate goal of better decision making. Growing up, a lot of my decision-making was based on random choices and lots (lots! lots!) of elderly advice. Being in this field forces me to take better evidence/data-backed decisions myself.</p>



<p></p>



<p><em>5. What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p>Data Science is filled with mind-boggling things that people work on. To name a few ‚Äì</p>



<ul><li>predicting future: which customer will leave the company; which patient will go on to develop a disease. And my personal favorite ‚Äì predicting who will commit bank fraud!</li><li>recommendations: Amazon, Etsy, Spotify, any and everyone who recommends stuff to customers uses data science to understand user preferences,</li><li>extracting handwritten text from scanned documents,</li><li>recognizing cats vs dogs in pictures,</li><li>chatbots, and many more.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<p><em>6. What keeps you going in your profession?</em></p>



<p>Two things: (1) the power of discovering answers from data and (2) there is so much more to learn and so little that I know.</p>



<p></p>



<p><em>7. What goals do you have in your career?</em></p>



<p>I want to gain depths of knowledge and experience to be able to drive decisions for high-impact business problems and create positive change. Eventually, I want to apply my skillset towards social good such as solutioning for climate change, agricultural productivity and plastic waste reduction.</p>



<p></p>



<p><em>8. What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in STEM?</em></p>



<p>I have had a very few women role models in STEM, whose stories of pushing through struggles and shattering the glass ceiling would be something I could look up to. I have also had fewer opportunities (than I would like) of working with compassionate and ambitious women in managerial/senior leadership roles. The reason I think having a supportive network of women is important because they can empathize better on certain experiences you witness in the career like for example, managing emotional intelligence while working as a part of a team. &nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p><em>9. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p>STEM lays the core foundation for innovation, and innovation is the only constant. So grab a seat at the table where decisions are made, be at the forefront of change and make use of the powerful tools that STEM has to offer to solve complex and rewarding problems.</p>



<p></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hi, I am Ami and I am a Biomedical and Instrumentation engineer. I am originally from India but have been living in the US with my husband and a toddler for quite some time. Back in India, I have worked as a service engineer and a bio-medical (a.k.a clinical) engineer for different companies and hospitals. Apart from that I enjoy cooking, traveling and occasional hiking. I have a degree in HR management and used to tutor kids in Math. Now after a long professional gap, I have decided to pursue Masters.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>1. What is your specific area of STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Engineering- I am a biomedical and instrumentation engineer.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>2. How would you explain your STEM field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a person who has years of experience in this field, I can boldly say that it is one of the most interesting and exciting fields one can study, research and work in. Biomedical and instrumentation engineers design medical equipments and devices like artificial organs, body parts and machines for diagnosing health related complexities.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>3. What are some challenges you face in this field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a biomedical engineer the biggest challenge that I&#8217;ve faced is dealing with the customers. In my experience, providing technical support involves on-site visits, working cross-functionally across teams, managing and staying up-to-date with inventories and nudging customers in the right direction to get a product or part that will suit their needs. But what I love the most about my role is that I get to work with customers and help them with a cost-effective equipment planning solution.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>4. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Physics and Math have always interested me. I love the challenges that science and technology throws at us. One day I just thought to myself, how incredible would it be to do something that could change or save lives? Biomedical and instrumentation engineering gave me the chance to do something meaningful with my life. I would say the field itself has proven to be an inspiration to me.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>5. What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Engineers in my profession put great effort in designing and successfully building artificial organs like kidneys, hearts, legs, joints, blood vessels and so on. We also build devices like pacemaker and hearing aids and provide support with it&#8217;s installation, maintenance and educate customers on it&#8217;s usage.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>6. You mentioned continuing your education after a long gap. How does it feel to get back in STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Honestly, I am really excited. It&#8217;s definitely going to be a bit of a challenge since I have a one year old to take care of but nevertheless, I feel empowered. I worked hard to get admission in graduate school- I even joined community college and started working on a field-related course. I manage home and take care of my kid and once my husband gets back from work, I take some time for myself and focus on the course. Over the past months I gained new skills and brushed some old ones. I feel inspired.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>7. What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am completely aware of the gender parity issue in STEM. Things are getting better but I firmly believe that we need more role models to rectify the fact and correct me if I am wrong, we as women have to work harder than men for gaining trust and respect of people in our field.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>8. What message would you like to give to our STEM moms?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As moms we face enough challenges every day, add education and it becomes a whole new level of juggling. It is important to stay positive and focus on the goods rather than the challenges because one day or the other your degree is going to open a whole new window of opportunities. One thing to remember and I don&#8217;t mean to sound cheeky- we are women. We have the ultimate gift of multi-tasking. So to all my ladies, brace up and conquer the world. All you need is a will and a dash of courage. Age is no bar and your kids are your strength, don&#8217;t stop pursuing your goals by making them your weakness.</p>

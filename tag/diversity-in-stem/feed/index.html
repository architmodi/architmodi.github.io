										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size">In high school I took an AP Psychology course that sparked my interest in understanding human cognition. I was particularly interested in what happens during our early years and how that shapes who we become as adults. During my freshmen year of undergrad, I enrolled in a philosophy course on Contemporary Moral Issues that inadvertently began my interest into interdisciplinary studies. As a Psychology major minoring in Neuroscience and Philosophy, I found a unexpected amount of overlap in content that encouraged me to incorporate concepts from unrelated courses in order to answer questions and engage in discussions on cognition. In the semesters that followed, I implemented what I had learned in my Contemporary Moral Issues class as a reminder of the guiding principles and biases that result from an individual’s personal history that can later show through in their research and academic endeavors. I also applied this lesson to my own thinking, so that I could try to minimize my own biases and be as open as possible in my studies.</p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>1. How would you describe your role?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am currently a Cognitive Science PhD Candidate at Brown University. In this role I take courses, conduct research, and work as a teaching assistant for undergrad classes. I am also the Educational Research Lead for the upcoming Katsuiku Academy in Tokyo, Japan. In this role I apply current research to policy and practice. I work with the team to develop a research-based curriculum that hopes to educate and nurture high school students in preparation for the future.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>2. What are some challenges you have faced in this research?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Valuation of this work and its wide-reaching broader impact. People oftentimes dismiss “soft” science fields and do not see the rigor and importance of the contributions we make.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>3. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I chose Cognitive Science because it allowed me to utilize methods and theories from fields outside of my department such as Education and Economics to answer questions about cognition.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>4. What’s the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The best way to enter the field is to familiarize yourself with it’s associated fields. Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind (i.e., cognition). It combines methods and theories from fields such as psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, and computer science etc. Skills that are important for building a successful career include an understanding of research methods, statistical analysis, coding languages, and computational modeling. For those that are interested in conducting research, additional experience in research traditional research methods like surveying and interviews, as well neuroimaging techniques (e.g. fMRI, EEG, fNIRS etc.) are invaluable.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>5. What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The most exciting/flashy thing people in my profession work on is artificial intelligence and machine learning. This includes self-driving cars, virtual reality simulation, and robotic companions for elderly people. Understanding how the brain processes information and executes actions allows us to reproduce these abilities in machines.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>6. What keeps you going in your research? What’s next for your career?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Improving the condition and future for Black and brown children. Although I am not sure of what exactly I will be doing, I hope to continue academic and social programming consulting and research to support children at the margins.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>7. What is it like to be a woman in STEM? What are some challenges that you have faced?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Being a woman in STEM is like being a woman in any part or sector of life. There is predisposition for men and even other women to dismiss or give passing acknowledgement to you as a scientist. This is exacerbated when you hold a BIPOC identity. It is important to ground yourself in why you are taking on these hurdles/challenges. Without this, imposter syndrome and stereotype threat can prevent you from reaching your full potential.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>8. What are 3 things that you wish could change about STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Barriers to access to STEM education and opportunities for BIPOC people that are present as early as childhood.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The myth of meritocracy-based advancement in academia. It is not the case that advancement is solely based on hard work, talent, and good scientific practice.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Blind trust and belief in past scientific research that is rooted in racism and oppression.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>9. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Self-advocacy. Getting the resources and mentorship you need, and ultimately getting to where you want to be career wise is dependent on advocating for yourself. I attended a large public university for my undergraduate degree, and I curated my ideal experience by seeking out help and opportunities. Sometimes that meant not going to the most obvious people (e.g. program counselors) because I didn’t fit the mold of a student that they perceived as successful.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Many times, people tell you to figure out what you want to do, but they don’t mention half the battle. You have to figure out what you’re not interested in to figure out what your passions and purpose is. I have worked in multiple labs and taken course work in various fields. Many of them weren’t for me, but those experiences allowed me to narrow down my interests and strengths.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#bd00ae;"><em>10. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Your unique experience and perspective are invaluable. Don’t be afraid to pour your personal self into your professional life. It could be the difference between novel contributions and self-actualization or going along just to get along.</p>



<p></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-medium-font-size">My name is Nicole Young and I am a developer and freelancer based in Pennsylvania, USA.&nbsp; I got into tech after I graduated from college with a degree in Psychology. I was planning on accepting an offer for a PhD but instead was given the opportunity to go to Malaysia for a year for an academic grant to teach English. When I returned, I wanted to continue to pursue opportunities where I could be more hands on and found a job at a tech startup. I learned so much in the two year that I was there and was introduced to coding and resources that inevitably helped me to teach myself development and start freelancing.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>1.What is your specific area of STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am a technologist. Not only am I a developer but I also pay attention to the trends, patterns and practices of the industry. I think that it is important to do that no matter the field.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>2.How would you explain your STEM field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I use my skills to help people build an online presence so that they can reach the people that they want to help. I build websites and provide other services to help people make a good impression online.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>3.What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I was inspired by the work that I was doing in my first job and inspired by all of the new things that I was learning. I chose Tech because it felt right to me. It was where I felt like I could make the largest impact.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>4.What’s the best way to enter your field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">No matter what age you are right now there are ways that you can start getting in to tech and coding right now! There are lots of games and websites geared toward helping young people understand how to code and build the problem solving skills that they need to be successful at it.&nbsp; Take some time to explore the websites and social media platforms that you are on everyday and learn a bit about how they are made. It will definitely amaze you!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>5.What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Anything that you can access on the web right now was built by someone with a development or engineering skill set, Developers like me work each day to create the cool websites, software, games and social media platforms that we all know and love!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>6.What keeps you going in your profession?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Keep a steady habit of learning is important and keeps me going. Also staying curious and wanting to push myself to create new and awesome things keeps me interested in what I do.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>7.What are your future career goals?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I would like to start my own organization where I help other women and people of color learn new tech skills for free where they can be placed in jobs that will give them new opportunities to learn a high paying skill.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>8.What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in stem?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It can feel lonely at times. I am often the only woman of color in the spaces that I am in and it can feel isolating and discouraging. There is also things like imposter syndrome (not feeling like I belong or am qualified enough to do what I do) and the feeling that I have to prove myself to those around me more than everyone else does.&nbsp; Those all can take a toll on you mentally and emotionally, which can make it tough to move forward sometimes.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>9.What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Stay curious and focused on your goals. Experiment and never be afraid to try new things.&nbsp; I think there is a lot of pressure on young people to have their lives figured out before they entered the real world and I want whoever is reading to know &#8211; that’s not true! It will take time but keep chasing the things that fill you with joy and fire because those things will lead you to what is best for you!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Hello! I&#8217;m Daisy and I&#8217;m an experimental quantum physics PhD candidate at the University of Surrey&#8217;s Advanced&nbsp;Technology Institute.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I&#8217;ve been interested in science for as long as I can remember, although I also have a passion for art and  was torn between pursuing art or science as a career. I eventually settled on science and opted to keep my creative pursuits as hobbies. What I&#8217;ve come to realise is that to be a scientist and a researcher you need to be creative so that side of me comes in handy when I&#8217;m solving problems and designing new experiments. Once I&#8217;d decided to do science I then had to decide which one! I knew I had more interest in the physical sciences and as physics was my favourite&nbsp;subject from when I was 16, I opted to do a physics degree.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">During the later years of high school, I had a lot of trouble with socialising and developed&nbsp;major depressive disorder and generalised anxiety disorder. It wasn&#8217;t until near the end of my degree that I was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and my challenges since high school began to make sense. I now have autism-specific support at my university and speak openly about the challenges and strengths of being autistic. During my degree, I had the opportunity to do a year of research for my master&#8217;s project so I applied to be a research and development intern at the Centre for Integrated Photonics where I worked on designing and testing semiconductor lasers for telecommunications applications. After graduating from my MPhys, I applied to do PhDs in quantum technologies and I started my PhD in 2018 working on a project on &#8216;development of InSb quantum point contacts for quantum technology applications&#8217;. I absolutely love my research and regularly talk about it as well as my experience as an autistic person in STEM and academia on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/notesfromthephysicslab/"><em>social media</em></a> and my <a href="https://www.notesfromthephysicslab.com/links"><em>blog</em></a>.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em><strong>1.What is your specific area of STEM?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My current sub-field is semiconductor spintronics. This falls under the larger field of quantum technologies. These fields are quite interdisciplinary with physicists, materials scientists, engineers and chemists all working within it. I approach my work from the perspective of experimental quantum physics, so I get to delve into the fundamental quantum physics phenomenon as well as looking at the fabrication and engineering side of things.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em><strong>2.How would you explain your STEM field?</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Semiconductor spintronics is a field which looks at exploiting electron spin in semiconductor materials for quantum technology applications. Let me break down all that jargon a bit: Semiconductors are a group of materials which can sometimes behave like a conductor and sometimes like an insulator. They have highly &#8216;tunable&#8217; properties and are the materials used in most technology these days. All of the transistors and other components in your phone and computer are made from predominantly semiconductor materials. They also make up a lot of the telecommunications infrastructure as semiconductors can be used to make lasers and other optical devices such as LEDs. Spintronics is short for &#8216;spin transport electronics&#8217; and it essentially is an extension of electronics. In electronics, we use the charge of electrons in materials to make technology and spintronics extends that to include an additional degree of freedom: spin. One of the most interesting applications of spintronics is in quantum computing where it is a key concept for solid-state electron spin qubits. My current research looks at ways to produce a current of electrons with a particular spin state using nanostructures made from semiconductor quantum wells which can be used to initialize&nbsp;spin-based qubits.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>3.What are some challenges you face in this field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It&#8217;s a very new field so there are still lots of things we don&#8217;t know. But in a way, this is what makes it exciting! More generally, I have some challenges with my communication and processing differences due to being autistic but I&#8217;m developing great self-advocacy skills to enable me to work to the best of my ability (and this isn&#8217;t really a field-specific challenge, just more of a general life challenge).</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>4.What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My decision to get into quantum physics comes from a class in high school. In chemistry, we were learning about electron shells in atoms and the concept of electron spin was mentioned. I instantly became fascinated with what this meant and asked my teacher who told me to ask a physics teacher. I did and since then had a fascination with quantum physics and the concept of spin. In fact, applied quantum physics is one of my longest-standing autistic &#8216;special interests&#8217; which is why I am so drawn to it as a career. I&#8217;ve also been very inspired by the incredible Emmy Noether since high school and find her to be such a role model for trailblazing women in physics and mathematics.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>5.What’s the best way to enter your field?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I don&#8217;t think there is one particular &#8216;best&#8217; route for anything really. If you want to be a quantum physicist I do think you need a good grounding in physics&#8211; whether that is a degree or an apprenticeship (for example, the National Physical Laboratory offers science apprenticeships).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>6.What are some really cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There&#8217;s always so much amazing research coming out of quantum technology! Probably the most notable is the recent work from Google reaching &#8216;quantum supremacy&#8217;. Although there is a lot of hype around it, we still have a long way to go (decades probably) until we see anything resembling a functioning, commercially viable quantum computer.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>7.What keeps you going in your profession?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Knowing that I am part of the research effort towards new technologies which help advance progress in a whole host of disciplines.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>8.What are your future career goals?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I would like to be working in quantum technology R&amp;D, whether that is in academia or industry. I&#8217;d also like to develop my science communication freelance work so that I can help educate people on physics online as well as raise awareness about topics I&#8217;m passionate about such as making STEM more accessible to disabled people.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>9.What is the biggest challenge you face as a woman in STEM?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I stick out within my research group due to my gender. I hope that in the future this isn&#8217;t the case but not many women progress to senior positions in physics and I&#8217;m very aware of that. Sometimes there are comments about my gender which strike me as odd because surely the most important thing about my academic work is the quality of my research, not my gender!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>10.What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you have a passion for STEM then go for it. Contrary to stereotypes, you don&#8217;t need to be anything apart from curious, determined and have a thirst for knowledge to work in STEM fields!</p>

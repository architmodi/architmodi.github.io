<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am a second year Cancer Research UK PhD student researching how to improve treatment for colorectal cancer. Specifically, I am looking at a protein KDM6a and researching why deleting this gene in mice prolongs survival.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">A PhD is notoriously stressful and time consuming. However, during lockdown the pace of my PhD drastically slowed down which gave me time to stop and reflect what it is I love about science. I realized what I love is breaking down complex topics into bitesize chunks that anyone could understand &#8211; and from this realization I launched my Instagram account ‘<a href="https://www.instagram.com/ella_explains/">@ella_explains</a>’. With this Instagram I hope to make science accessible to everyone.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Something that is hugely important to me is work life balance. Research can very easily become all consuming so I make a huge effort to be very efficient while I work to maximize the time I have away from the lab. It’s very easy to become overwhelmed by the enormity of the research. In my spare time I ride my horses, spend time with friends, family (and of course my dog) and generally find other creative outlets.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>1. What is your specific area of STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I work in cancer stem cell research. Stem cells are cells which are able to change themselves into multiple different cell types. Tumors contain some of these stem cells and what makes them tricky is that these stem cells are resistant to cancer treatments we have at the moment. That means when you give a person a cancer treatment most of the tumor dies, except for the stem cells, and because they can turn into multiple other cell types they can reform a tumor. I am looking at trying to understand these stem cells better in the hope that we can make cancer treatment better.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>2. What are some challenges you have faced in this research?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Working in research is like trying to solve a puzzle &#8211; which means mentally it can be quite draining. Sometimes I find it very difficult to leave my research at the door when I go home in the evening so I get a bit stressed out and burnt out as a result. Hopefully I will get better at this!&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>3. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I chose to be a biologist because it was the subject I found the most interesting at school. However, the field is so vast that I spent a lot of time stressing about which part of biology I wanted to study. I chose to go to The University of Edinburgh because it had so many different undergraduate courses which enabled me to change my mind easily &#8211; which I did &#8211; 3 times! I settled on Stem Cell biology and fell in love with it &#8211; stem cells are incredible.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>4. What’s the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I think if you have the drive to be a research scientist you will get there. The most important thing is to have a hard working attitude which will get you a place in a lab. Classically most people start with a masters and move on to a PhD after that &#8211; but neither of these are essential. I was super lucky and my supervisor was so pleased with the data from my undergraduate project I was employed as a technician to continue the work. This gave me very valuable experience meaning I never had to do a masters before my PhD. A PhD wasn&#8217;t the only option however, you can remain working in a lab without one and work up to positions such as lab manager.&nbsp;<br />I think in order to do a PhD you have to be very determined &#8211; it&#8217;s a tough process that can be very demanding at times &#8211; but very rewarding in the long run! Unlike a university degree which is lots of memorizing information research involves having to explore one tiny aspect of science in very fine detail &#8211; meaning it is nothing like the degree! I think having a creative mind is often an asset to a researcher where you are designing experiments and devising solutions to problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>5. What keeps you going in your research? What’s next for your career?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Research is very demanding both in time and mental capacity. So I think it’s really important to keep reminding yourself of the bigger picture. Ultimately my research could help save lives &#8211; so that is a major factor that keeps me going. At the moment I don’t think I will continue my career in research. However, I hope to delve into the world of science communication but I am also keeping an open mind as I may enter a new field entirely. Research is teaching me so many life skills which would help me in any future career I choose.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>6. What is it like to be a woman in STEM? What are some challenges that you have faced?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are distinctly more men in my office than there are women and additionally an even smaller percentage of these women occupy principle investigator roles. I think young people are often inspired by imaging themselves in roles those around them occupy and a lack of females means a lot of girls can’t imagine themselves in these roles. However, I do believe the tide is turning on this and with help from projects like #STEMUp we will have more diversity in STEM.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>7. What are 3 things that you wish could change about STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I would like STEM to be a little less intense &#8211; it is possible to advance your career and have a life outside of your STEM field.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I would make STEM more diverse &#8211; and I am hopeful this will happen in time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I would like the ‘pressure to publish papers’ to be relaxed &#8211; and for research to be considered more of a journey than just a mission to publish papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>8. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">When I was at school I was fortunate enough to have speakers come in and tell me about their STEM field. This enabled me to understand the range of jobs that were out there. This is why I now run a science communication Instagram as an attempt to make science more accessible and less intimidating for everyone. I think more initiatives like this is the best way to promote more women into STEM.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>9. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Don’t be intimidated by the STEM fields, don’t think they are just for ‘smart’ people. STEM fields are for hard working people who want to make a difference in the world &#8211; so if you are interested &#8211; go for it.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am a 5<sup>th</sup> year PhD Candidate in Genetics at the University of Georgia.

<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>1. How would you describe your job/role?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">A PhD candidate is somewhere between a student and full-flung researcher. I no longer attend courses, but I am still very much learning. As a graduate student, it is less about memorization and more about problem solving, planning, and applying your knowledge in new ways. I still have a professor who helps in my growth and a committee I update on my progress towards my degree. I have a lot of independence to dive into projects and examine what interests me, with the support of my mentors.<br>A vast majority of my project involves examining thin slices of tissue under a microscope looking for proteins. These proteins glow under florescent light due to a process I put them through, making these beautiful technicolored images. The reason I do this is because I am interested in discovering if certain genes are present in the tissue and are making these proteins. These genes could unlock how the parathyroid and thymus are created!</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>2. What are some challenges you have faced in this research?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My biggest challenge is that the process to make the proteins “glow” (called immunohistochemistry) is easy to mess up. It requires following an exact protocol, otherwise precious samples could be lost forever. There is nothing more frustrating than going through two days of work, looking under the microscope, and seeing nothing! Also, being a PhD candidate can be hard because there are high expectations of your productivity. It can be easy to lose yourself in your work and forget to take a break! Work-life balance is very important in STEM.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>3. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I have always wanted to go into a STEM field, although I didn’t know that I wanted to go into genetics until high school. My mother got her degree in geology, and while she got pushed out of the field due to sexism (my mother was made to do paperwork while her male colleagues got to do field work), she wanted me to know that I could be whatever I wanted and to disregard anyone who said otherwise. Her voice drove me to pursue higher education and be the first person in my family to attend graduate school.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>4. What’s the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I don’t think there is any right way to pursue genetics. A lot of the advice I hear is to join a lab <em>as an undergraduate</em>. But personally, I went to a small liberal arts school and while I got exposure to lab work, this was very different than larger campuses where you can join a traditional “lab”. I also took a gap year between undergraduate and graduate to work in science policy!<br>The closest I came to getting “lab experience” was a few months as a post-baccalaureate researcher in what would eventually become by thesis lab. I think if you’re passionate about being a STEM researcher you can do a lot to gain experience! You can take a gap year and work in biotech, you can be a technician in a lab, you can do research as an undergrad, or even in high school! Whatever works for you and your life experience.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>5. What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are <em>so </em>many things you can do with a degree in genetics! You can work in biotechnology (think companies like 23andMe), biomedicine (Interested in curing cancer? Think about the growing field of immunotherapy!), academia (professors not only get to teach the next generation of scientists, they can continue to make extraordinary jumps in science), science communication or journalism (what better person to explain what CRISPR is than someone who has used it?), or science policy, which is what I plan on going into.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>6. What keeps you going in your research? What’s next for your career?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am a big believer that science should benefit all of society. My current research lands firmly in the biomedical field, which means some day my research might help a future scientist develop a cure to a disease or create a new treatment. Science is constantly building upon itself, so if I could provide even just one leg up to the next scientist with my data, I know I’ve done good.<br>Next up for my career to take my love of science and beliefs about science helping society to the next level- science policy! I am passionate about biosecurity, which means protecting the public from anything that could harm them of biological origin, from pandemics to anthrax. Scientists are always needed in fields like this because we provide expertise and understanding.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>7. What is it like to be a woman in STEM? What are some challenges that you have faced?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Being a woman in STEM can be hard, I won’t deny it. I’ve been sexually harassed by professors and disparaged by male colleagues. I have been told more times than I can count that I am “too pretty to do science” which is, abjectly, the most horrendously stupid thing I have ever heard. Your appearance has nothing to do with your ability to do science. Race, gender, or ability have zero impact on your ability to do science. Luckily, for every comment like that I have met an incredible person who is succeeding and thriving in STEM and is there to support me. And with online and in person communities fostering and supporting diversity in STEM, it is easier now than it has been in the past (for people like my mother) to find a home in STEM. I have so many queer and women role models in STEM that I look up to now!</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>8. What are 3 things that you wish could change about STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">1) The gender and racial disparity in STEM. There are not nearly enough people of color or women in these fields.<br>2) The pressure on graduate students. Graduate students in STEM have some of the highest levels of depression and anxiety, typically due to the sometimes very toxic environments in academia.<br>3) The “Ivory Tower” mentality. Science should be easily accessible and understandable. Scientists can often get lost in their niche that they only ever communicate with other scientists. Most of our research is funded by the public, so our research should be too, not hidden behind paywalls!</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>9. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Exposure. You cannot know if you are interested in something if you’ve never witnessed it! For example, my mother often bought me toys that were from the “boys” section because that’s where things like science kits, dinosaur toys, and other STEM-related toys were located. I am so glad that in recent years this has changed some, but a lot of work still needs to be done. A Barbie in a lab coat is great, but let’s push our girls to keep asking questions and to not be discouraged in school (especially high school). Let’s show them famous women scientists and what they discovered, and let’s get them in the lab, behind the computer, or in the field out having <em>fun</em>.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>10. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Never, ever let anyone tell you that you aren’t good enough to be what you want to be. That includes adults! If something makes you excited or curious, chase that feeling. If you change your mind, that is totally fine, but let it be because <em>you</em> want to do something else, not because the world said you should. It’s hard, I know, but sometimes being stubborn isn’t a bad thing.<br></p>

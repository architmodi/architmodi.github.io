<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am a second year Cancer Research UK PhD student researching how to improve treatment for colorectal cancer. Specifically, I am looking at a protein KDM6a and researching why deleting this gene in mice prolongs survival.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">A PhD is notoriously stressful and time consuming. However, during lockdown the pace of my PhD drastically slowed down which gave me time to stop and reflect what it is I love about science. I realized what I love is breaking down complex topics into bitesize chunks that anyone could understand &#8211; and from this realization I launched my Instagram account ‘<a href="https://www.instagram.com/ella_explains/">@ella_explains</a>’. With this Instagram I hope to make science accessible to everyone.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Something that is hugely important to me is work life balance. Research can very easily become all consuming so I make a huge effort to be very efficient while I work to maximize the time I have away from the lab. It’s very easy to become overwhelmed by the enormity of the research. In my spare time I ride my horses, spend time with friends, family (and of course my dog) and generally find other creative outlets.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>1. What is your specific area of STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I work in cancer stem cell research. Stem cells are cells which are able to change themselves into multiple different cell types. Tumors contain some of these stem cells and what makes them tricky is that these stem cells are resistant to cancer treatments we have at the moment. That means when you give a person a cancer treatment most of the tumor dies, except for the stem cells, and because they can turn into multiple other cell types they can reform a tumor. I am looking at trying to understand these stem cells better in the hope that we can make cancer treatment better.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>2. What are some challenges you have faced in this research?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Working in research is like trying to solve a puzzle &#8211; which means mentally it can be quite draining. Sometimes I find it very difficult to leave my research at the door when I go home in the evening so I get a bit stressed out and burnt out as a result. Hopefully I will get better at this!&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>3. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I chose to be a biologist because it was the subject I found the most interesting at school. However, the field is so vast that I spent a lot of time stressing about which part of biology I wanted to study. I chose to go to The University of Edinburgh because it had so many different undergraduate courses which enabled me to change my mind easily &#8211; which I did &#8211; 3 times! I settled on Stem Cell biology and fell in love with it &#8211; stem cells are incredible.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>4. What’s the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I think if you have the drive to be a research scientist you will get there. The most important thing is to have a hard working attitude which will get you a place in a lab. Classically most people start with a masters and move on to a PhD after that &#8211; but neither of these are essential. I was super lucky and my supervisor was so pleased with the data from my undergraduate project I was employed as a technician to continue the work. This gave me very valuable experience meaning I never had to do a masters before my PhD. A PhD wasn&#8217;t the only option however, you can remain working in a lab without one and work up to positions such as lab manager.&nbsp;<br />I think in order to do a PhD you have to be very determined &#8211; it&#8217;s a tough process that can be very demanding at times &#8211; but very rewarding in the long run! Unlike a university degree which is lots of memorizing information research involves having to explore one tiny aspect of science in very fine detail &#8211; meaning it is nothing like the degree! I think having a creative mind is often an asset to a researcher where you are designing experiments and devising solutions to problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>5. What keeps you going in your research? What’s next for your career?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Research is very demanding both in time and mental capacity. So I think it’s really important to keep reminding yourself of the bigger picture. Ultimately my research could help save lives &#8211; so that is a major factor that keeps me going. At the moment I don’t think I will continue my career in research. However, I hope to delve into the world of science communication but I am also keeping an open mind as I may enter a new field entirely. Research is teaching me so many life skills which would help me in any future career I choose.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>6. What is it like to be a woman in STEM? What are some challenges that you have faced?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are distinctly more men in my office than there are women and additionally an even smaller percentage of these women occupy principle investigator roles. I think young people are often inspired by imaging themselves in roles those around them occupy and a lack of females means a lot of girls can’t imagine themselves in these roles. However, I do believe the tide is turning on this and with help from projects like #STEMUp we will have more diversity in STEM.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>7. What are 3 things that you wish could change about STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I would like STEM to be a little less intense &#8211; it is possible to advance your career and have a life outside of your STEM field.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I would make STEM more diverse &#8211; and I am hopeful this will happen in time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I would like the ‘pressure to publish papers’ to be relaxed &#8211; and for research to be considered more of a journey than just a mission to publish papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>8. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">When I was at school I was fortunate enough to have speakers come in and tell me about their STEM field. This enabled me to understand the range of jobs that were out there. This is why I now run a science communication Instagram as an attempt to make science more accessible and less intimidating for everyone. I think more initiatives like this is the best way to promote more women into STEM.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-bright-blue-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>9. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Don’t be intimidated by the STEM fields, don’t think they are just for ‘smart’ people. STEM fields are for hard working people who want to make a difference in the world &#8211; so if you are interested &#8211; go for it.</p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>1. How would you describe your role?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Right now, I am a last year PhD student (I plan to defend my thesis in June 2021) at an Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Cracow. However, my favorite way to describe myself is young scientist! I love my job because I get to do a little bit of everything &#8211; I am writing my thesis, managing funding, publishing, leading my own project, working as the vice president of the student council, preparing for scientific stay in the US, and in my free time I love to talk about science!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>2. What are some challenges you have faced in this research?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Anxiety and imposter syndrome are two challenges that I am still working on. I believe the best way to overcome problems is facing them, which is why I always try to push myself to do things outside of my comfort zone.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am currently leading a project concerning nanomaterials. The whole process from writing the proposal, getting the funding to actually doing the research has been an equally amazing and terrifying adventure. Being in charge is extremely gratifying but also requires being prepared for the unexpected.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>3. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My journey into STEM was… a bumpy one. In school I liked math, physics and chemistry… but it wasn’t reciprocated. Even though we had a complicated relationship, my fascination with STEM began in school, when I almost didn’t pass physics class and was made to prepare a presentation about black holes. I started reading a lot of books and I just got hooked on. (We’re made of star stuff?! The Universe is how old?! A teaspoonful of a neutron star would weigh a billion tons?!). The less I understood, the more information I craved. Even though it took me a lot of work and effort, I’ve managed to work on my math and chemistry and decided to go into STEM.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I chose Materials Engineering for my Engineer and Master Degrees as I was looking for something connected with chemistry, but at the same time I wanted that sweet, sweet engineer title. Materials Engineering seemed fun and challenging and that’s how I am were I am today!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>4. What’s the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Materials Science is a fascinating field that combines chemistry, physics and a lot of engineering and if you want to pursue a scientific career and/or a PhD in it, you should start with choosing the right path at the university. Studying Materials Science or Materials Engineering is a great way to start but it’s not the only way! I have friends who are pursuing a PhD in Materials Science, although they have a master’s in physics, chemistry, bioengineering, electronics or metallurgy. This often gives them a unique perspective on the world of Materials Science.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Other than choosing the right studies, the most important thing is to learn to take (calculated) risks (which I’m pretty sure applies to all fields in STEM!). Think big, don’t be afraid – apply for internships and apprenticeships (especially ones that are abroad – there are many ways to fund those!), ask professors if you can help in the lab, look for mentors (there are a lot of mentorships programs in different STEM fields), join societies or science clubs (it’s an awesome way to meet people and work on those soft skills). Get as much of various experiences as you can and stay curious!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>5. What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Everything around us is made from materials – so materials science touches our lives in every possible way. Personally, I work on metals that are liquid at room temperature (just like mercury, however in my case those metals are nontoxic and safe to handle). But people in Materials Science work on all kinds of cool materials and technologies like aerogels (materials literally made from up to 99.8% of nothing), breathable liquids (liquids, that can have so much oxygen dissolved in them that you would actually be able to breathe in them) or shape memory alloys (those are metals that can change shape if for example the temperature changes!).</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>6. What keeps you going in your research? What’s next for your career?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">What keeps me going is the challenge and the opportunity to try new things, go to new places, and meet new people. I put a lot of effort and time into my research because I have fun and I love what I do!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">What’s next? I am not sure yet! I have a few months left in my PhD and although (despite its many problems) I love academia, I would love trying to flirt a bit with industry. At the moment I’ve secured funding for 3 months stay at University College London after my PhD, and I am actively looking for new opportunities!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>7. What is it like to be a woman in STEM? What are some challenges that you have faced?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Materials Science is a STEM fields where there are a lot of women (at least when it comes to students &#8211; it gets worse after getting a PhD). Last year in Poland almost 48% of materials engineering students were female. The data however does not lie – at the grad school level almost the same amount of men and women get funding (for projects, grants and scholarships), however the proportion changes the higher the step in the career is (for example in Poland, for a grant dedicated only for professors, only 8% of the grants were awarded to woman).</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>8. What are 3 things that you wish could change about STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f5e3.png" alt="🗣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Open access to science – the process of publishers getting all the money, while the authors and reviewers don’t see a penny out of it and then the readers have then to pay for it horrendous amounts of money… It’s not okay. Science should be accessible to all.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f5e3.png" alt="🗣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Communicating science to the public – the public doesn’t really understand how science works (the misconceptions about Covid-19, are just another proof of that) and we, as scientist and people in STEM, are not doing enough to change that. We don’t talk about how we do science; we don’t try to explain our results in an understandable way, we just don’t talk to the people who very often are the ones paying for the research through their taxes.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f5e3.png" alt="🗣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Mental health in STEM – there is often a very unhealthy culture in STEM (it will depend on the place, the group and the people but it happens more often than not), forcing people to work long hours, not take breaks and just keep comparing yourself to others. Studies show that the mental health of a lot of PhD students is not the best (in Nature PhD Survey 2019, 36% of students reported that they have sought help for anxiety or depression caused by their PhD studies!) and that is something that should be addressed.</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>9. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am not an expert in the field (however there is some scientific research done concerning the topic and I would love to learn more) but what would have personally helped me was to not treat science as a gendered issue. Boys are shown how cars work, for girls it happens much less often. Teachers and parents often assume that boys should be able to repair things or solve computers problems, automatically sending a signal to girls that they don’t need to have that knowledge. We buy boys a lot of cool, science-y toys, and we buy girls dolls, and we expect the kids to form the same interests. Hand on experience with science and technology would have helped me, personally, when I was younger.</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>10. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Being a scientist is a viable career option and it allows you to learn new stuff every day, travel the world and push the limits of the Unknown. It’s not going to be easy, but it will be worth it. If you’re curious and willing to work hard, you can do it!</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">My name is Alex and I am a scientist on my journey to get a PhD in Materials Science at the<br>Institute of Metallurgy and Materials Science in the Polish Academy of Sciences! I love a<br>good challenge, and my PhD provides plenty.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">For my Masters I specialized in ceramic materials, writing my Master thesis based on<br>research performed during an internship at the CEA in France. For my PhD I decided that I<br>needed a change and now my work focuses on metals with gallium.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I wholeheartedly believe in the power of science communication and in my free time I love<br>talking about science and I hope to inspire people to see Materials Science as the amazing<br>field that it is!</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>1. How would you describe your role?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Right now, I am a last year PhD student (I plan to defend my thesis in June 2021) at an Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Cracow. However, my favorite way to describe myself is young scientist! I love my job because I get to do a little bit of everything &#8211; I am writing my thesis, managing funding, publishing, leading my own project, working as the vice president of the student council, preparing for scientific stay in the US, and in my free time I love to talk about science!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>2. What are some challenges you have faced in this research?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Anxiety and imposter syndrome are two challenges that I am still working on. I believe the best way to overcome problems is facing them, which is why I always try to push myself to do things outside of my comfort zone.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am currently leading a project concerning nanomaterials. The whole process from writing the proposal, getting the funding to actually doing the research has been an equally amazing and terrifying adventure. Being in charge is extremely gratifying but also requires being prepared for the unexpected.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>3. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My journey into STEM was… a bumpy one. In school I liked math, physics and chemistry… but it wasn’t reciprocated. Even though we had a complicated relationship, my fascination with STEM began in school, when I almost didn’t pass physics class and was made to prepare a presentation about black holes. I started reading a lot of books and I just got hooked on. (We’re made of star stuff?! The Universe is how old?! A teaspoonful of a neutron star would weigh a billion tons?!). The less I understood, the more information I craved. Even though it took me a lot of work and effort, I’ve managed to work on my math and chemistry and decided to go into STEM.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I chose Materials Engineering for my Engineer and Master Degrees as I was looking for something connected with chemistry, but at the same time I wanted that sweet, sweet engineer title. Materials Engineering seemed fun and challenging and that’s how I am were I am today!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>4. What’s the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Materials Science is a fascinating field that combines chemistry, physics and a lot of engineering and if you want to pursue a scientific career and/or a PhD in it, you should start with choosing the right path at the university. Studying Materials Science or Materials Engineering is a great way to start but it’s not the only way! I have friends who are pursuing a PhD in Materials Science, although they have a master’s in physics, chemistry, bioengineering, electronics or metallurgy. This often gives them a unique perspective on the world of Materials Science.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Other than choosing the right studies, the most important thing is to learn to take (calculated) risks (which I’m pretty sure applies to all fields in STEM!). Think big, don’t be afraid – apply for internships and apprenticeships (especially ones that are abroad – there are many ways to fund those!), ask professors if you can help in the lab, look for mentors (there are a lot of mentorships programs in different STEM fields), join societies or science clubs (it’s an awesome way to meet people and work on those soft skills). Get as much of various experiences as you can and stay curious!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>5. What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Everything around us is made from materials – so materials science touches our lives in every possible way. Personally, I work on metals that are liquid at room temperature (just like mercury, however in my case those metals are nontoxic and safe to handle). But people in Materials Science work on all kinds of cool materials and technologies like aerogels (materials literally made from up to 99.8% of nothing), breathable liquids (liquids, that can have so much oxygen dissolved in them that you would actually be able to breathe in them) or shape memory alloys (those are metals that can change shape if for example the temperature changes!).</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>6. What keeps you going in your research? What’s next for your career?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">What keeps me going is the challenge and the opportunity to try new things, go to new places, and meet new people. I put a lot of effort and time into my research because I have fun and I love what I do!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">What’s next? I am not sure yet! I have a few months left in my PhD and although (despite its many problems) I love academia, I would love trying to flirt a bit with industry. At the moment I’ve secured funding for 3 months stay at University College London after my PhD, and I am actively looking for new opportunities!</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>7. What is it like to be a woman in STEM? What are some challenges that you have faced?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Materials Science is a STEM fields where there are a lot of women (at least when it comes to students &#8211; it gets worse after getting a PhD). Last year in Poland almost 48% of materials engineering students were female. The data however does not lie – at the grad school level almost the same amount of men and women get funding (for projects, grants and scholarships), however the proportion changes the higher the step in the career is (for example in Poland, for a grant dedicated only for professors, only 8% of the grants were awarded to woman).</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>8. What are 3 things that you wish could change about STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Open access to science – the process of publishers getting all the money, while the authors and reviewers don’t see a penny out of it and then the readers have then to pay for it horrendous amounts of money… It’s not okay. Science should be accessible to all.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Communicating science to the public – the public doesn’t really understand how science works (the misconceptions about Covid-19, are just another proof of that) and we, as scientist and people in STEM, are not doing enough to change that. We don’t talk about how we do science; we don’t try to explain our results in an understandable way, we just don’t talk to the people who very often are the ones paying for the research through their taxes.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left has-medium-font-size">3. Mental health in STEM – there is often a very unhealthy culture in STEM (it will depend on the place, the group and the people but it happens more often than not), forcing people to work long hours, not take breaks and just keep comparing yourself to others. Studies show that the mental health of a lot of PhD students is not the best (in Nature PhD Survey 2019, 36% of students reported that they have sought help for anxiety or depression caused by their PhD studies!) and that is something that should be addressed.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>9. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am not an expert in the field (however there is some scientific research done concerning the topic and I would love to learn more) but what would have personally helped me was to not treat science as a gendered issue. Boys are shown how cars work, for girls it happens much less often. Teachers and parents often assume that boys should be able to repair things or solve computers problems, automatically sending a signal to girls that they don’t need to have that knowledge. We buy boys a lot of cool, science-y toys, and we buy girls dolls, and we expect the kids to form the same interests. Hand on experience with science and technology would have helped me, personally, when I was younger.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-medium-font-size" style="color:#ff6200;"><em>10. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Being a scientist is a viable career option and it allows you to learn new stuff every day, travel the world and push the limits of the Unknown. It’s not going to be easy, but it will be worth it. If you’re curious and willing to work hard, you can do it!</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am a 5<sup>th</sup> year PhD Candidate in Genetics at the University of Georgia.

<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>1. How would you describe your job/role?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">A PhD candidate is somewhere between a student and full-flung researcher. I no longer attend courses, but I am still very much learning. As a graduate student, it is less about memorization and more about problem solving, planning, and applying your knowledge in new ways. I still have a professor who helps in my growth and a committee I update on my progress towards my degree. I have a lot of independence to dive into projects and examine what interests me, with the support of my mentors.<br>A vast majority of my project involves examining thin slices of tissue under a microscope looking for proteins. These proteins glow under florescent light due to a process I put them through, making these beautiful technicolored images. The reason I do this is because I am interested in discovering if certain genes are present in the tissue and are making these proteins. These genes could unlock how the parathyroid and thymus are created!</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>2. What are some challenges you have faced in this research?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">My biggest challenge is that the process to make the proteins “glow” (called immunohistochemistry) is easy to mess up. It requires following an exact protocol, otherwise precious samples could be lost forever. There is nothing more frustrating than going through two days of work, looking under the microscope, and seeing nothing! Also, being a PhD candidate can be hard because there are high expectations of your productivity. It can be easy to lose yourself in your work and forget to take a break! Work-life balance is very important in STEM.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>3. What made you choose this STEM discipline? Were you inspired by someone?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I have always wanted to go into a STEM field, although I didn’t know that I wanted to go into genetics until high school. My mother got her degree in geology, and while she got pushed out of the field due to sexism (my mother was made to do paperwork while her male colleagues got to do field work), she wanted me to know that I could be whatever I wanted and to disregard anyone who said otherwise. Her voice drove me to pursue higher education and be the first person in my family to attend graduate school.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>4. What’s the best way to enter your field? What kind of experience or skills should one possess to build a successful career in the same?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I don’t think there is any right way to pursue genetics. A lot of the advice I hear is to join a lab <em>as an undergraduate</em>. But personally, I went to a small liberal arts school and while I got exposure to lab work, this was very different than larger campuses where you can join a traditional “lab”. I also took a gap year between undergraduate and graduate to work in science policy!<br>The closest I came to getting “lab experience” was a few months as a post-baccalaureate researcher in what would eventually become by thesis lab. I think if you’re passionate about being a STEM researcher you can do a lot to gain experience! You can take a gap year and work in biotech, you can be a technician in a lab, you can do research as an undergrad, or even in high school! Whatever works for you and your life experience.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>5. What are some cool things that people in your profession work on?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There are <em>so </em>many things you can do with a degree in genetics! You can work in biotechnology (think companies like 23andMe), biomedicine (Interested in curing cancer? Think about the growing field of immunotherapy!), academia (professors not only get to teach the next generation of scientists, they can continue to make extraordinary jumps in science), science communication or journalism (what better person to explain what CRISPR is than someone who has used it?), or science policy, which is what I plan on going into.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>6. What keeps you going in your research? What’s next for your career?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am a big believer that science should benefit all of society. My current research lands firmly in the biomedical field, which means some day my research might help a future scientist develop a cure to a disease or create a new treatment. Science is constantly building upon itself, so if I could provide even just one leg up to the next scientist with my data, I know I’ve done good.<br>Next up for my career to take my love of science and beliefs about science helping society to the next level- science policy! I am passionate about biosecurity, which means protecting the public from anything that could harm them of biological origin, from pandemics to anthrax. Scientists are always needed in fields like this because we provide expertise and understanding.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>7. What is it like to be a woman in STEM? What are some challenges that you have faced?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Being a woman in STEM can be hard, I won’t deny it. I’ve been sexually harassed by professors and disparaged by male colleagues. I have been told more times than I can count that I am “too pretty to do science” which is, abjectly, the most horrendously stupid thing I have ever heard. Your appearance has nothing to do with your ability to do science. Race, gender, or ability have zero impact on your ability to do science. Luckily, for every comment like that I have met an incredible person who is succeeding and thriving in STEM and is there to support me. And with online and in person communities fostering and supporting diversity in STEM, it is easier now than it has been in the past (for people like my mother) to find a home in STEM. I have so many queer and women role models in STEM that I look up to now!</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>8. What are 3 things that you wish could change about STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">1) The gender and racial disparity in STEM. There are not nearly enough people of color or women in these fields.<br>2) The pressure on graduate students. Graduate students in STEM have some of the highest levels of depression and anxiety, typically due to the sometimes very toxic environments in academia.<br>3) The “Ivory Tower” mentality. Science should be easily accessible and understandable. Scientists can often get lost in their niche that they only ever communicate with other scientists. Most of our research is funded by the public, so our research should be too, not hidden behind paywalls!</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>9. What do you think can help get girls into STEM?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Exposure. You cannot know if you are interested in something if you’ve never witnessed it! For example, my mother often bought me toys that were from the “boys” section because that’s where things like science kits, dinosaur toys, and other STEM-related toys were located. I am so glad that in recent years this has changed some, but a lot of work still needs to be done. A Barbie in a lab coat is great, but let’s push our girls to keep asking questions and to not be discouraged in school (especially high school). Let’s show them famous women scientists and what they discovered, and let’s get them in the lab, behind the computer, or in the field out having <em>fun</em>.</p>

<p class="has-yellow-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>10. What message would you like to give to our young readers?</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Never, ever let anyone tell you that you aren’t good enough to be what you want to be. That includes adults! If something makes you excited or curious, chase that feeling. If you change your mind, that is totally fine, but let it be because <em>you</em> want to do something else, not because the world said you should. It’s hard, I know, but sometimes being stubborn isn’t a bad thing.<br></p>
